I don’t know if it’s because it maintains the feel and tone of the first, continues to deconstruct superhero concepts, or turns the focus on Elasti-Girl as the bread winner in the family while Mr Incredible plays Mr Mom (a classic in my household); but I love this movie!

However, I have a plot issue (maybe not a hole per se) regarding the Underminer. We are introduced to this Mole Man rip off at the end of the first Incredibles, and he caps off the beginning of the sequel, but after that battle, he’s gone.

Shutter Island...clarification of ending??,movies,2,a3lgh0,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/a3lgh0/shutter_islandclarification_of_ending/,7,2018-12-06 01:40:05,"So I've watched Shutter Island twice now and it's quickly become one of my favorite movies. A masterpiece, and a truly stunning and mind-warping experience.

I pretty much understand everything now. But one thing that's still a little strange to me is the ending. I've read in articles and stuff that the movie shows that the entire role-play treatment worked on Andrew. Worked as in, it did drive him to the end of realizing and fully admitting that his fantasies are all made up and to accept the truth that he killed his wife because she killed their kids...more so, he failed because he knew she was mentally troubled for a long time but didn't do anything about it.

He can't live with that guilt...it's too unbearable, so that final scene...he pretends to regress back into the ""Teddy"" character who pretends he's still a marshal, etc. Now, everything points to him pretending to regress so that he is lobotomized...he WANTS to be lobotomized so he doesn't have to feel the pain of his guilt anymore. But his doctor, sitting on the steps with him, hears him ""regress"" back into Teddy, and shakes his head at Dr. Cawley and the others, indicating that he's regressed again and will have be lobotomized.

So sure, the entire role-play treatment did work, but the way the movie ends, it would seem to suggest that the doctors and warden believe that since he has regressed again (or so they think), they think their entire treatment did NOT work. The only thing that undermines this is how Andrew gets up and walks calmly ahead, ready to be lobotomized, and the guards and doctors follow. What are they thinking in this moment? Aren't they wondering why Andrew WANTS to be lobotomized? And I find it hard to believe they would go ahead with the surgery if Andrew was practically asking for it...it would no longer be necessary if he wasn't violent.",False,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

What are some examples of movies where you're surprised to see characters making realistic decisions and suffering realistic consequences?,movies,8,a3ek9j,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/a3ek9j/what_are_some_examples_of_movies_where_youre/,25,2018-12-05 12:40:03,"I just finished watching Eighth Grade and I was absolutely blown away by the levels of realism this movie uses.

Eighth Grade is a movie about a shy teenage girl trying to gain confidence. In a typical movie, this girl would win over the dream guy, become cooler than the mean popular kids, and enter high school as a confident badass. Won't get into specifics, but I was so amazed to see Eighth Grade do not just a different take on that story, but instead they did it in an incredibly down to earth, ""holy shit that happened to me"" kind of way. 

 I appreciate it when a movie uses realism, because it's almost like a little twist. You expect the character to do the ""movie plotline"" choice, but when they act like a *real person*, or suffer consequences that *real people* experience in that situation, you're taken aback because movies **never** do this. 

I can't help but think of [this scene](https://youtu.be/zRClOJWK9zg) from the Nice Guys when thinking of other examples. You expect this scene to go to the formula: he breaks the glass, unlocks the door, and searches the empty building for clues.  When this didn't happen, I knew I was about to experience something unique.

So I'm trying to find other movies that surprise you in this fashion. As I said, Nice Guys is like this, obviously Eighth Grade is too. Searching is another one that's fairly similar.

In an effort to maintain some semblance of integrity, I sometimes watch ""bad"" movies to calibrate my personal ratings scale, specifically the lower end (1-5/10), and avoid slipping into a 6-10/10 grading scale (can be misleading for recommendations).

Issues with numerical ratings in creative works aside, I think this might be a fun and potentially eye-opening exercise for /r/movies. The at-a-glance information might also be useful in identifying fellow users that, for recommendation purposes, not only share similar tastes, but also share a similar perspective on rating scales. 

So, post your list of movies with every entry fitting into a different quality bracket/interval of a 10-pt rating scale (starting with 1/10 and working down to 10/10). I'll start:

1. The Room (2003)
2. Battlefield Earth (2000)
3. Paul Blart: Mall Cop (2009)
4. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014)
5. Rampage (2018)
6. The Faculty (1998)
7. Overlord (2018)
8. I Saw the Devil (2010)
9. Kill Bill (2003)
10. 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)

Movie Dialogue,movies,0,a3jvbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/a3jvbg/movie_dialogue/,8,2018-12-05 22:07:17,"Alright reddit here’s my thoughts. 

I was watching Terminator Salvation again this evening and several times I felt like the dialogue was poor. The particular worst instances were 

1. When John Connor says, “I’ll be back.” I don’t need to explain why I feel that was poor writing. I get it, it’s just a little homage to the original lines from original Terminator, but still. It’s like when C3P0 falls down and says, “ I’ve fallen and I can’t get up!” As a viewer I kinda feel like it’s schlocky. 

2. When Barnes and Connor are testing the short wave radio scrambler on the hunter killer. The scene opens with Barnes saying something like,”We’re in Skynet’s valley of death. We’ve never been this deep before.” I immediately thought, why would he say that to John Connor, he would certainly know how deep the resistance has been? 

So, obviously the writers felt the need to add those lines in so the audience would be able to know what / where the scene was taking place. I can accept the reason, but still feel the dialogue is kinda weird. 

So, my questions are, is this type of dialogue necessary? 
Is this type of dialogue what people complain about when they criticize shitty writing? 
What are you guys’ thoughts on dialogue as a tool? 
And finally, can you give me examples of what you think some poor dialogue is in any particular movie? 

Ultimately, I am the easiest non critical movie fan, so It takes a lot for me to notice something like poor writing. So, I’d like to get a broader feel. 

It doesn’t have to be Terminator Salvation. For the record I enjoyed the movie, just at certain parts I considered the dialogue question.

Was pleasantly surprised at how good the plot was. I thought it'll be just 'wow look how rich they are' over over. The whole thing with the Mom not approving his wife was pretty fun to watch.

Wow Singapore is rich now?? I thought was the same as Thailand and Vietnam and those other countries.

Movie detail: There was a part where the Mom gives a complement and says 'wow self-made woman, your Mom must be very proud'. That was actually an insult, because she didn't talk about her self that much, she mostly talked about her Mom in a self-made story. So her saying that, neglects her Mom's struggle. It' hard to explain, you just gotta see that scene again with this in mind.

Very cool to see Jiang Yang from Silicon Valley! I love that show!

When the shirtless scenes came on, I was like 'oh boy, here we go again' because usually sexy Asians in film tend to have really good abs, but not so well developed back muscles. This time it was the opposite, decent abs, but very well defined back muscles.

When she said 'I can't make you a man', come back of the century! I wonder if it's a reference to Mulan.

It's not a fear of originality. It's a fear of losing their jobs by green lighting films that flop at the box office.

The possible twist to the upcoming Glass film.,movies,0,a3l91c,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/a3l91c/the_possible_twist_to_the_upcoming_glass_film/,5,2018-12-06 01:08:54,"Without making you read a bunch, cuz this theory is lonnnng winded.. and also has an extra meta higher dimensional theory on top of it afterwards.... My theory is that all the super characters as well as others are delusions inside the girls head. The girl from Split, that is. I forget her name.

Now my reasoning. I remember contemplating what the twist could be and this idea occurred to me. I figured it must be the girl who acts as the stage. So I watched the movie a second time looking for possible clues. I got the impression big time for some reason that I was right. I could smell it, but that doesn't really count as evidence.

But then... Evidence happened. The scene where the old lady psychologist visits Mr. Split. She sneaks away to open the door to find one of the teenage hostages... Do you remember? Did you notice it too?

The old lady is standing there clear as day in the open door yet the teenager calls out, hello? Is anyone there? Heellllp! Or something like that.

Huh? Is she blind? Was the writing bad? Why would she ask if anyone is there when the old lady is standing right there in plain view?

I think it means my theory could be correct. Somehow. I believe this was an intentional clue to show us that the old lady wasn't really there in some capacity. And since we are dealing with crazies I figure it means she is also another imagined character. But in whose head?

James Macavoy's head? What would be the point in that? Surprise! It turns out he imagined the therapist! *Gasp* A schizo having an imaginary shrink. I don't think so. 

Could all of this be taking place in Mr. Glass' head? It's possible, I suppose. But to me, that seems too obvious and kinda anti-climactic. Lazy even.

To me.. it's gotta be the girl. Right? Think about it for a sec. It seems like each super character could represent a different type of coping mechanism of having a big, fat, hairy uncle molest you.

Let's start with Unbreakable himself and also his son. The girl lost her dad who she clearly looked up to. The one who could've protected her, but didn't and unknowingly allowed her to be molested cuz she didn't speak up. And then of course died. SO she imagines a version where her dad can't die and she's his little sidekick who helps him discover his powers. Perhaps as she should've done by telling him she was being raped. And not only that, he's a fucking badass hero that could easily choke out a big dude. Kinda like the uncle. 

It just occurred to me that it's interesting that Unbreakable choked out the orange man. Wasn't the uncle wearing orange hunting colors? I can't remember. I don't exactly wanna go Google CHILD MOLESTATION SCENE. So forgive me.

Okay so now we have Mr Glass. That could easily represent the broken feeling of being raped by a big fat hairy uncle,right? He's broken yet he's highly intelligent. Much like she is. Mainly due to the fact that she has been put through adversity like Mr. Glass.

It's like Unbreakable and Mr. Glass represent a kind of duality for her character. On one hand she needs to be strong to face life having to be raped by a fat uncle, as she clearly is... yet at the same time she is broken by it.

Then we have Split. This one is multi-faceted. To me.. he seems like some kinda agent of agency. If that makes sense. Let me back up a sec though. If she is in fact crazy now, she might have some vague understanding of that fact. If she's in the system or seeing a shrink, she is no doubt surrounded by folks telling her she is crazy and trying to treat her for it, et cetera. So he could represent a a version where she realizes in some sense she is delusional. 

He (and the movie's plot) would also represent a scary situation that she herself survives, ya know? She didn't have to create a hero or powers to survive him. She doesnt have to be a villain and forward her hurt on others like Mr. glass. 

Instead of being a victim, she used her real life ingenuity and agency to survive him and in the end this part of her psyche acknowledged her for it. It howls as it realizes she is strong and beautiful for having survived some shit in life. Ya know? And she just so happens to immediately take agency against her uncle in the end of the movie. Hmmm.

She could pretend it's not happening and let it continue by numbing herself to it: Unbreakable.

She could let it break her and in turn let it turn her into a villain to society, cutting herself, being miserable and distant to other girls etc: Mr. Glass

Or she could take a giant step back and literally GET some agency in life and do something about it: Split.

But also..I believe Split represents a sort of balance between the two extremes, or a catalyst to it. And the coming film, Glass is the result of her waking up to this and taking agency. But it's not so simple and there will be a battle in her psyche between them all. 

The three form like a triangle with Split being at the top point.. and her character is a spot above the triangle if that makes sense. I believe the next movie will really establish this as this most recent one had to kind of set it up.

If you think this isn't possible cuz of her age I would posit that each delusion comes with a fully fleshed out back story, just like Split does, and she wouldn't exactly need to fit a tight timeline. She is 3 or 4 and starts imagining a hero figure. Then she imagines the movie Unbreakable over time etc.



Anyway so all that aside. I also noticed the movie is like a meta story about Shyamalan himself. This is what ultimately led to my whole theory in the first place. 

Basically M Night retconned his own tumultuous relationship with Hollywood and success into the Unbreakable universe.

He was this new badass writer AND director. He was celebrated as the best shit since sliced bread. Sixth Sense. 

He makes Unbreakable, his masterpiece, the best hero film ever made. Nobody really goes to see it. He knows it's the shit, but money talks. Doubt creeps in. He better go with the plot twist hard next time.

He makes Signs. It's a success. Phew. But did people like, get it? Or did they just like aliens and Mel Gibson? Oh well, his real fans got it. Fuck the plebs. He's the shit.

He makes The Village, a beautiful love story disguised as a horror story. Nobody got this one. They shit all over it. Cuz they're dumb. He is the shit. Fuck em.

He makes Lady In The Water and shits back at the plebs writing himself in as a world changing brilliant writer and also writes in plebs to be  eaten by monster. Well, the plebs shit back harder, big time.

Everyone turns on him and he makes dud after dud after dud for years. Fuck. Was everyone right? Is he NOT the shit?

So then he starts writing Split. I believe he represents the girl in the story for sure as well as Macavoy's character. 

Basically, M. Night sees himself as both a good and bad director. He wants to believes he's a good director. Unbreakable. He doubts himself. Mr. Glass. And the movie Split is his battle between the two ways he sees himself. As he is writing, he realizes he's got a hit on his hands. He has hope again! Just like the girl does by the end of the film. He sees his failures as learning experiences etc.

Anyway that's my long ass double theory. Sorry for the long read.

Hello all!

/r/Letterboxd was basically completely abandoned by its sole creator/moderator, and the sub pretty much turned into a profile spam-fest, so I created /r/LetterboxdOfficial. I figured we could actually use a sub that could serve as a companion to Letterboxd itself, focusing more on the social aspect (discussion, list sharing, community challenges, etc.). We're not very big as a sub yet, but we're up to a little over 400 subs right now - not a bad start!

&#x200B;

Since we've opened the sub, we've implemented some of the most requested features to reduce spamming across the board and I think it's worked out pretty great so far. We've got user flair, post flair, a Discord server, Letterbotd (a neat bot to call upon if you're looking for quick film information), and much more!

This week for our [Film Club](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetterboxdOfficial/comments/a1z74a/no_christmas_for_you_last_week_winner_new_poll/), we're watching the last film that was voted for ([Dogtooth](https://letterboxd.com/film/dogtooth/) by [Yorgos Lanthimos](https://letterboxd.com/director/yorgos-lanthimos/)) and voting for a new film. We'll be discussing Dogtooth this coming Friday, 12/7, so be sure to watch the film (available on [Kanopy.com](https://Kanopy.com) with a library card or student email) and discuss, share your reviews, and any accompanying lists!

Ice Cube and Lawrence Fishburne are the two highlights in terms of performance in my opinion. If you really want a compass that represents the positive and the negative, their two characters are it.

The film is also very unforgiving to its characters and doesn't pull any punches in its tone, all the while staying true to a narrative.

My main reason for this is that Toy Story 3 was such a great ending that to continue the story after that would feel strange. However, Toy Story 4 could be a prequel that follows Andy's Dad and how he came across Woody. Toy Story 4 was quoted to be a very emotional film and Tom Hanks teared up recording the lines. So I don't want to entirely recap the story described in this video so I really recommend watching it but Andy's Dad supposedly died right before Toy Story 1(Andy has a sister who is an infant so it can't be more than 2 years since he died). Andy's dad was also named Andy and he was born in the 1950s and cursed with the horrible disease of polio. He was poor and could not afford many toys but his favorite show(Sheriff Woody) was holding a contest to win a Woody doll. However, he could not collect the required amount of boxtops to win the doll but he sent in a sweet letter asking for the doll with pictures drawn over it. The same year, 1957, Sputnik was launched and toy companies figured that kids were tired of cowboys and would only want spacemen toys. There was only one prototype so they decided to send it to Andy Sr. Fast forward to right before Toy Story 1, Andy's dad dies of Post-Polio syndrome but right before he gives Andy a key to a chest with all his toys. They have been in hibernation and since Andy Jr looking strikingly like his dad and has the same name, they think it is the same Andy. In the teaser, you see a homemade toy, which I think could be a toy Andy Sr. makes due to the lack of money to buy his own toys. The only piece of evidence that disputes this theory are the toys that were not at the beginning of Toy Story 1 are in the teaser.

Why are you expecting more from it?"" I always hated this response because there *are* dumb characters/movies that I actually like. I have been really thinking about explicitly why I hate the two main characters in this movie so much and not other ""dumb characters."" I wanted to find something objective and not just ""bad writing"" because that's so vague and rather subjective. I think I've figured it out.

&#x200B;

Let me compare two dumb characters: Jim Carrey in D&D and oh say Sid from ice Age. They're both dumb, overconfident idiots who screw things up and are played for laughs. I ***hate*** Jim Carrey but don't mind Sid. What's the difference? When Sid does something stupid, it comes back to bite him. Either it directly hurts him, or other characters do something. Meanwhile with Jim Carrey, he NEVER faces any consequences for his stupidity. His stupid antics cause other people grief instead.

&#x200B;

In short, when Sid is stupid, he gets smacked. When Jim Carrey is stupid, he smacks everyone else.

&#x200B;

To me this completely breaks the movie. Ultimately, D&D portrays the two mains as stupid but it's trying to still say ""hey they're good people inside and you want them to succeed don't you?"" which makes me want to scream because I find they have given me literally zero reason to root for them. They've ruined several innocent people and faced absolutely zero repercussions. 

&#x200B;

When I realized this, my main reaction was ""why does this not seem to bother most other people?"" D&D is liked by a huge amount of people and I'm clearly in the minority. But....why? Isn't connecting with characters supposed to be, like, the whole point? This extends to other characters I feel are presented as ""feel bad for them"" when they are just irredeemable jackasses (Julia Roberts in My Best Friend's Wedding and Lestat in Interview with a Vampire are the other main ones that come to mind for me).

One of these shorts, ""Meal Ticket,"" is the story of >!an impresario and a limbless orator who travel the West offering recitals of sonnets, biblical passages, Shakespeare, and Lincoln speeches. Eventually the demand for this show falls off and the impresario decides to go with a mathematician chicken instead of the limbless orator and throws the limbless orator off a bridge into a river and kills him.!< It's a bleak, bleak story. 

I have this theory about it that makes it even bleaker. I'll start by saying I'm probably wrong but as I watched the film I couldn't shake the following idea. During the course of the story >!the impresario goes to a brothel. He keeps the limbless orator in the room with him as he and the prostitute have sex. After their session the prostitute asks if the limbless orator wants any loving too? ""No,"" the impresario replies. ""Has he ever had any?"" she asks. ""Once,"" the impresario says. !<

Many people online are asking what the impresario meant with his answer. **Here is what I kept thinking: the limbless orator was once caught having sex with the impresario's wife and as punishment the impresario cut off his limbs and forced him to work for him.** 

There are a few things that support this theory: First, the impresario >!looks quite gleeful when he murders the limbless man!<. Second, the material limbless man recites are often concerned with things being severed (Ozymandias poem has a trunkless body, Lincoln's Gettysburg Address is about the US Civil War where the southern states cut themselves off from the Union, *The Merchant Of Venice* is famous for Shylock demanding his pound of flesh). Finally, the limbless narrator quotes the book of Genesis where Cain complains that his ""punishment is too much to bear.""

Again, I realize this is crazy and probably not right but I just couldn't stop thinking about it during my initial watch and then my re-watch of the film.

Discussion: Anyone else feel really sorry for the Alex Jones and Bob Taylor characters in Denis Villenueve's superb thriller 'Prisoners'?,movies,1,a39xbz,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/a39xbz/discussion_anyone_else_feel_really_sorry_for_the/,13,2018-12-05 02:03:58,"Firstly, what an amazing movie - epitome of a mystery plot, superb acting overall, interesting symbolism of imprisonment threaded througout, deep look into major ethical issues like torture, and attention to detail. Pretty much every thing I want in a thriller.

Anyway, I didn't see any Internet post focusing primarily on these two characters despite their plight being way worse than what the protagonists of the movie encountered:

1. Both get kidnapped as kids. Alex Jones is released in his late teens or young adulthood; either way, considering he must be 16+ (due to valid license), he was kidnapped for at least a DECADE. That's a decade's worth of drugging and brainwashing and possibly even physical and sexual abuse - this massively dwarfs what the protagonists' (the Dovers and Birches) children faced.

2. Severely depleted mental and social development. The long-term drugging and brainwashing would very likely have contributed to the mental retardation (he was said to have the IQ of a 10yo) attributed at least to Alex Jones. Both Bob and Alex were unable to interact normally with people or speak ill of their captors. A decade+-long kidnapping would also mean no school and hence inability to develop the basic academic and intellectual skills. The kidnapping involved having the kids finish puzzles in a book, except the last puzzle was unsolvable. For Bob, desperate to get out, this would've meant obsessing over that last puzzle for months, if not years. Eventually, with no other stimulation, as an adult he develops an unnatural obsession for that one last puzzle in addition to snakes and children's clothes, the only other things abundant in his environment. The kidnapping truly screwed their entire lives up in just about every way.

3. Last but certainly not the least, on top of all this, now after they've already suffered through so much they are treated extremely poorly by the outside world. Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman's character) himself kidnaps Alex and tortures him mercilessly, smashing up his face and then showering him with extreme hot and cold water while being imprisoned in a dark room. Now it may be argued Alex could've given up the children's whereabouts right away, but I'm sure the decade-long brainwashing of not speaking against his captors would've surely played a role. In hindsight, we could see Alex had clearly not harmed the children in any way. Similarly, Bob, with all that psychological trauma capped with Detective Loki's attack on him, desperately commits suicide.",False,0.6003,0.066,0.706,0.228

While Po was able to forgive Shen for killing his parents, Shen could not let go of his own past. Shen was obsessed with the prophecy that a panda was destined to stop his goals. He slaughtered all of the pandas in China and weaponized fireworks into a cannon to guarantee his victory. His actions horrified his parents, who banished him from Gongmen city.

Perhaps I'm reading too much into it; maybe the film is just a story about two charming psychopaths who found each other.  But PTA movies usually have some deeper commentary to them.  Is the broader thematic idea of Phantom Thread that women, as romantic interests, can only impede great men?  It's only after the introduction of the love interest that the leading man's confidence wavers and his mental state deteriorates.

Alma's individuality is an inconvenience to Reynolds for much of the film.  Her adoration is worthless to Reynolds, her needs immaterial.  She only ever captures his imagination by becoming an agent of his destruction.  What are we supposed to take away from that?  That being in a functioning relationship with an ingenious man who's hyper-devoted to his craft necessarily requires a cycle of abuse?  I couldn't help but think that PTA, the hyper-devoted genius, was mirroring his own love life in some way, but as far as I know he's been happily married for more than a decade.

**Notable Box Office Stories**

* **Ralph Breaks the Internet -** In more of a win by default, Ralph Breaks the Internet took #1 this weekend with a solid $25.7M[.](https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/ralph-breaks-the-internet.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1) That's not an amazing hold but for opening over $80M during the Thanksgiving break it's not too bad, most notably putting it on track with Moana which many felt opened somewhat low in the same spot but ended up pulling out an almost $250M domestic run. Ralph's drop though is a bit worrisome when you compare it to the first film which is the rare Disney Animation Studios film to not crack $200M domestic and $500M worldwide. With a stronger start it's possible that RBTI will manage to pass those milestones but just barely. Disney Animation rarely makes sequels but in the pipeline already is Frozen 2 and Zootopia 2 so RBTI is one of the first of this new generation of sequels to make it to market, but I don't think it's really comparable to this film which already is as close to a niche property as modern Disney gets. It's unclear where Disney goes from here. For one it's possible RBTI is a favor to director Rich Moore who apparently helped saved Zootopia and turn it into the massive hit it was. And it could be Ralph is just profitable enough to justify itself and garner some interesting film twitter conversations along the way. But I wouldn't be shocked if this is the final full adventure for Ralph. I can see Disney transitioning him into more of a Mickey Mouse role, an interesting figure who more exists as brand identity than a fully fleshed out character. 
* **Possession of Hannah Grace -** I had a whole bitter write-up about this film but it got deleted and I realized who cares. The studio didn't, why else release a horror film with no pre-screenings for critics in one of the historically worst weekends of the year. Are you shocked it only made $6.5M at #7? Is it really that crazy it got a 13% on RT and a C score on Cinemascore. This is a classic cynical dumping grounds movie and it's not really even worth my time to get that upset about it.
* **Bohemian Rhapsody -** The surprising hit film about unknown indie rock band Queen has hit some major milestones this week. First off, it became the highest grossing music biopic domestically after passing the lifetime gross of Straight Outta Compton ($161.1M). Secondly, it has now become the first film in history that stars an openly queer protagonist to pass $500M worldwide. This is a huge step in queer representation on screen for one key reason, films need to appeal globally these days and globally the world ain't as woke about queer people as they are in the US. [Just take a look at this map](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/World_laws_pertaining_to_homosexual_relationships_and_expression.svg) and note that all the beige countries have laws restricting freedom of queer expression and the yellow, orange, red, and maroon countries are places where it is illegal to have romantic/sexual same-sex relations (the maroons are the death penalty for such relations btw). When you get a bigger view of just how far the fight for queer civil rights is from being over it becomes more clear why Hollywood is so reticent to send out queer characters in major blockbuster films. That's the weird thing about Hollywood, for how liberal so many of the filmmakers are their exports are becoming more conservative as they appeal to a more global market. Just look at the insane backlash when Hollywood patted itself on the back for praising itself having queer characters in films like Beauty and the Beast '17 and Power Rangers '17. And despite the queer representation being as mild as possible those films still had notable calls for being banned in repressive countries. While Bohemian Rhapsody has had some blowback from the queer community for its depiction of Freddie Mercury's bisexuality, it is a film that openly acknowledges Mercury having male and female partners with romantic scenes with both. Now I do understand it isn't the ultimate end all be all of queer representation stepping forward. This is still a film that could be viewed by homophobic people as ""look at the gay getting his just desserts by dying of AIDS"". It's also historical fact that Mercury was bi so it's not quite the same as say making a Wonder Woman movie where her new love interest is a woman. And it's quite possible the film is heavily edited in more homophobic countries. But still seeing the film making almost $15M in a very repressive against gays country like Russia is pretty interesting and hopefully a step forward in more queer representation in the future. 
* **Oscar Movie Round-Up -** Even the Oscar expansion race didn't have much to speak of with only **The Favourite** getting a few more screens. The film jumped to 34 theaters but made over $1M in just that small release, a per theater average of $32,500. The film is looking more and more like it has some surprising box office potential, perhaps lead by the wonderful dark trailer or the just general interest and fascinating with British monarchy kicked off recently by Netflix's The Crown. Whatever the reason it will be interesting to follow as the film very slowly creeps towards a wide release throughout December.

A Review of Bob Lazar: Area 51 and Flying Saucers - the new UFO film by Jeremy Corbell,movies,1,a367s8,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/a367s8/a_review_of_bob_lazar_area_51_and_flying_saucers/,4,2018-12-04 18:25:02,"I went to the LA premiere of Corbells' new film - Bob Lazar: Area 51 and Flying Saucers. These are my opinions of the film.

I won't spoil any new subject matter or footage featured in the film out of respect for Corbell as an independent filmmaker.

Unfortunately... the film was a dud. Corbell missed a big opportunity here. It comes across as a love letter to Lazar and his story, packaged for the masses, but has little in the way of actual substance. It does not go in-depth at all - in fact there are YouTube docs that are way more in-depth than this - and for a subject that is treated so seriously, it is watered down by massive amounts of filler. There is so much amazing footage that is not shown or featured that you can find on the internet that could have been utilized; it really is a shame.

In all fairness - there IS some new information and never-seen-before footage. There are also some extended looks at old interviews that are mildly interesting. The issue is, the amount of ""new"" material is vastly overshadowed by bells and whistles. The film tells the BASIC story and provides a few minor revelations, but that is about it.

Half of the run time of the film is sucked up by pretentious soliloquy segments (pieces of which make up most of the trailer) narrated by Mickey Rourke, who must have showed up drunk. No one around me, including myself, could understand a word he was slurring. I call this the ""Bane effect"", as this is an audio mixing (and casting) problem that marred The Dark Knight Rises.

Furthermore, technically, the film is a mess. The audio levels are all over the place (going from muffled to peaking in seconds). Often, Corbell interviews his subjects in echo-y locations (George Knapp is interviewed in a pool area and the reverb is obnoxious, Lazar gets similar treatment as well). Do you have a lav Jeremy? You gotta invest in a lav and stop relying on the Zoom recorder. Also, the structure of the film is all over the place, and copious amounts of the run-time is afforded to things that don't pay off, giving new meaning to ""style over substance"".

Corbell seems like a nice dude, seems like he has the best intentions... but for a film about Bob Lazar, Corbell is ALL OVER the thing. If you ever wanted to see Jeremy Corbell barefoot, in his kitchen, talking on the phone - this is the film for you. If you want to see Corbell in a pink-lit bathroom, being sad in slow motion - this is the film for you. I fear that he is going the way of Steven Greer - starting with good intentions, getting good footage and access to interesting subjects, and eventually falling prey to hubris and looking like a complete fraud in the end. It's a slippery slope Corbell, watch out buddy.

Don't listen to me though, if you wanna see it, check it out. Gotta give Corbell props for trying. He's amassed quite a following, but it's all about how you use it.

  A live action Black cauldron would be absolutely *insane* to see in today’s age. It’s familiar yet unique enough to be interesting, and since the original film was dark already, it would be intriguing to see how that translates into the world of 2019+.

  But it doesn’t have to stop there! Disney could also make treasure planet and Atlantis live action films as well- these are the movies with unique plots that went under appreciated when they were released, and I think that with the dearth of original ideas now- these pioneering adventures would do very well rebranded into the age of contemporary (post 2010) cinema.

Whoever thought to team up Russel Crowe & Ryan Gosling in a buddy cop/detective comedy is a genius. Like, really. From those two leading actors I've only seen dramatic roles (Goslings best for me in BR49 & Crowe undeniably in Gladiator) but they perfectly delivered the comedic stuff.

I loved the obvious reference and influence that was the Coen's ""The Big Lebowski"" (1998), which happens to be one of my favorite movies of all time. The movie moves at its own speed, has some really memorable dialogue and well written and funny humor. The storyline itself is also interesting and takes a lot of really suspenseful turns towards the third act.

The only stuff I didn't completely like was the ""Be a good person and don't kill this guys"" relationship between Holly & Jackson, felt kinda off and the last scene with Kim Basinger felt a bit unnecessary.

Did I love it? Yes. But he and where the story goes still managed to take me off guard and I can't stop thinking about it.

 For a while this is his most lively and colorful film, it still has his trademark off-center weirdness, but high energy. The performances are still unique, but more humane. The dialogue is fast, occasionally hilarious, and what he does with the period, sort of pointing out how ridiculous it all is, is great. Like the extremely elaborate, and increasingly ridiculous dance number for the queen. Or Nicolas Hoult's character literally popping up at random in any scene, with no one really ever bringing attention to this fact. No matter where a character is, outside, inside, in their bedrooms, in the basements, the dark hallways, etc. He just always stumbles into a scene and lays waste to everyone around him. Sort of hoping he get's a supporting actor nod, but it's probably a long shot. 

&#x200B;

Then about half-way through the film slowly takes a turn. The humor is drained from the atmosphere, there's a cold grasp and quiet sadness that starts creeping up. Things become a bit creepy, character dynamics start changing, Emma Stone starts becoming almost diabolical, a strange empathy is felt for Weisz, her downfall is as delicious as Stone's social climbing is exciting, and then kind of frightening. The ominous soundtrack plays for long periods of time, just adding a sense of impending doom. Above all is Olivia Coleman. Like, holy damn, her performance is absolutely incredible. She's not afraid to strip herself entirely of vanity and make her rather abrasive and unpleasant, but then you figure out why she is this way, and it becomes sad and pathetic. Her screaming at the band and the whole build up to her fainting when she actually has to face her people, she is laugh out loud funny at times, but also a trainwreck. Seriously, what a miserable existence. 

Finally, here come the final moments. What's left for the characters? Nothing really. Stone gets her way, but lost her soul in the process. All Coleman has left is her title as a queen even if she doesn't have much control or power, and nearly every one dislikes her. No respect for her at all. Even Stone. Who squashes a bunny (please tell me that was partially cgi), which confirmed my hatred of her at that point. Which is funny since I quite liked and was rooting for her at times initially. It seems in a flash the truth smashes into Coleman, she feels the betrayal, so she takes advantage of Stone. In that AMAZING final shot, all life drains from Stone's face, she's back to being a scabrous whore, and I think she knows it. The queen gives in to her misery, and you realize Weisz was kind of right the whole time. But it's a bitter ending for her as well. Then you realize what a huge, cruel, joke, all these people's lives are in the first place. 

Anyway, I'd love to hear how this film made anyone else feel, during and after. I thought it accentuates all of Lanthimos' best qualities as a director, but never loses his voice. It's rich, layered, hugely entertaining, and then knocks the wind out of you. I'd say it's an instant classic in the period piece sub-genre, and for sure one of my favorites. Definitely my favorite film by the director as well. I guess you'd could say it's more accessible, but even then it's still going to be pretty challenging and uncomfortable for those not familiar with him.

Discussion: Many of this year's expected Oscar hopefuls are fizzling out. Thoughts?,movies,0,a31jab,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/a31jab/discussion_many_of_this_years_expected_oscar/,25,2018-12-04 10:15:31,"Compared to last winter, when a lot of Oscar front-runners came out to terrific reviews/Rotten Tomato scores, were well-liked by audiences,and had at least decent box office returns (Lady Bird, Shape of Water, Dunkirk, Call me by your name, etc.), this year's expected Oscar front-runners are fizzling out both due to weak box office, little to no word of mouth, and just OK critical reviews. Here are a few movies that I assumed would be huge this year:

\- **Beautiful Boy** was a movie I thought on paper would be a slam-dunk, an opportunity to net two terrific actors (Chalamet and Carrell) an Oscar each. But it only got a 68% RT score, had a very weak release schedule, and middling box office. I haven't heard much discussion around it, with the critical consensus being that the acting is great, but the story doesn't deliver. I honestly really wanted to see it, but its release was so short and sparse (in the major city i live in) that I never got to see it. 

\- **Boy Erased** also looked like a front-runner to me. 82% on RT is just OK. I work in an LGBT field and I honestly don't know a single person who has seen this movie (compare to Dallas Buyers Club, where people in my field organized events for people to see the movie). Another movie I personally wanted to see, but the showtimes and theater locations are very sparse. It also doesn't help that First Reformed is on a similar topic and appears to be getting more studio backing for awards. 

\- **Can You Ever Forgive Me?** is another well-reviewed movie that wasn't distributed or marketed widely enough to generate any word of mouth.

\- **First Man** was well-reviewed and actually got enough showtimes that people could see it. The difficult subject matter, long run time, and somewhat misleading marketing (which made it look more action-oriented, like The Martian) may have turned off audiences. This translated to weak box office and very little buzz. While Gosling is still a contender for Best Actor, the movie itself is likely out. 

\- **Mary Queen of Scots** looks like a shoo-in due to the fantastic cast and renewed interest in British monarchy, but the reviews are just decent (81% RT as of now). It also doesn't help that The Favourite is being released around the same time, another female-led, British royalty period piece starring A-list actresses that seems to have a catty tone. This could lead to confusion between the two movies.

\- **Widows** was Steve McQueen's follow-up to 12 Years a Slave and hits all the right notes for an Oscar contender: racial/civil rights undertones, a message about local politics and race that feels important, and a great ensemble cast. But the audience wasn't there and there's very little word of mouth. I personally liked this movie, but no one is really talking about it. 

\- **Green Book** seemed like a standard, commercially-friendly, accessible view of race, along the lines of Hidden Figures and Driving Miss Daisy, that middle America audiences enjoy. Although the audience score is good, the RT critics score is just OK (82%) and there seems to be no word of mouth about the movie.

**- Bohemian Rhapsody** is a different story. It got middling reviews (62% RT), but audiences seem to enjoy it. Despite most people I know saying the movie was just OK, there's still tons of word of mouth and I know people who have seen it multiple times in theaters already for the musical performances and Rami Malek's performance. I counted this one out as an Oscar front-runner after the RT reviews, but it might sneak in as an ""audience favorite"" pick.

\- **Vox Lux** has pretty good, but not amazing RT reviews so far (84%). Despite having a marketable plot and lead actress, the story sounds really similar to A Star is Born.

This year, the only movies that seemed to live up to their awards hype so far have been A Star is Born and Black kkklansman, which may have been released too long ago for voters to remember. Upcoming movies may find themselves ""canceled out"" by having the misfortune of being about too similar a topic as another major movie this year. Or one actor has so many movies out this year that people can't choose which good performance to vote for (Lucas Hedges, Steve Carrell, Bradley Cooper).

Theory: Netflix's The Christmas Chronicles was intended to be a Found Footage film.,movies,0,a33j7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/a33j7h/theory_netflixs_the_christmas_chronicles_was/,7,2018-12-04 13:48:05,"For anyone not already familiar, The Christmas Chronicles is a Netflix film that was recently released and stars Kurt Russell as Santa Claus. Basically, a couple kids stow away in his sleigh on Christmas night. This leads to zany Christmas antics, of course. 

What I want to focus on, for those of you who have seen this reasonably fun but not too special movie is a plot device. The little girl in the film carries a camcorder throughout the movie, and documents the events in a way that feels reminiscent of found footage films, such as The Blair Witch Project, Cloverfield, and the similarly titled ""Chronicle"".

This leads me to wonder: was this at one point in production, perhaps early in its writing phase, intended to be a found footage film?

The DNA is all there. The story works for that sort of concept, there's a reason given for the character to carry the camera around the whole night, and she indeed captures most scenes through the camera's lens, even though we only see a small segment of those scenes that way ourselves.

I can't say that any of this is conclusive evidence that this was written or entered production as found footage,  and I wonder, if it had started off life as some sort of ""North Pole Witch Project"", what might have happened to change that?

My basic conclusion is that found footage has suffered a loss of popularity of late, and of course if the target audience was younger folks, like ages 5-12, the format might be confusing.

"What actors/characters stick out in your mind, as a great villain in the past 20 years?",movies,31,a2qyvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/a2qyvy/what_actorscharacters_stick_out_in_your_mind_as_a/,64,2018-12-03 12:44:34,"Was thinking about this the other day.  It's a hard thing to do without coming off cheesy or cliche with dumb lines.  For me, sometimes movies build up the protagonist so much, that in my mind, the villain is no match for them.  So it won't be a buildup that is even a fight or worth it.  The best that can do it, really make you hate them.  Or they are just plain crazy.  The best are UNIQUE villains, taking obscure approaches.  For example, Heath Ledger taking on The Joker.  Either way, my point is, you want them to lose MORE than you want the good guy to win. 

Here are my top 3, I think:

1.  **Christof Waltz - Inglorious Bastards**

It might be his script but he pulls this off so great.  Coming across charming and well spoken at first.  Then he turns on a dime.  Opening scene was one of the best at making me feel anxious in my seat.  Great character.

2.  **Javier Bardem - No Country For Old Men**

The has to be one of the TOP villains of all time.  Unpredictable.  His own set of ""rules or values"", as Woody Harrelson put it.  He was very strange, yet very smart.  Hell, Llewelyn was kind of a badass in his own right but I felt as though Bardem's character was sort of this grim reaper of a dark cloud that really couldn't be defeated.  Credit to Coen bros for casting a great bad guy (also Billy Bob in Fargo)

3.  **Daniel Day Lewis - Gangs of New York**

One of the greats of our time, shown in a different light as a villain.  He's got it all. If you're PC bro, you will def get triggered.  He's a racist, sexist, bigot, homophobe etc etc.  He's an excellent shit talker, that is battle tested and can back it up.  He's also a ruthless, honorless killer.  The scene where he straight up stabs Brendan Gleeson in the back, then add's him to his own kill stick (""notch 45""), is great.   

Honorable Mentions:  

**Rufus Sewell** is an extremely underrated villain.  Knight's Tale, The Illusionist, Man In The High Castle.  He's one of the great's when I think of people that can play a great sarcastic prick.

**Joaquin Phoenix** in Gladiator.  I don't think I've wanted someone to die as much in a movie as I did his character.  I bet it's what Geoffry 
 in GoT got his inspiration from.  It's a villain that is and will be timeless, as is the movie.

I'd like to hear what other's are, as I'm sure I'm leaving a ton out!  No google, just off the top!

Creed is supposed to be a motivational film series like Rocky, yet ironically the heavyweight fight that took place over this weekend was in my opinion, *more* inspirational than the Creed counterpart.

For those who don't know who these guys are:

- [Tyson Fury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyson_Fury) is a heavyweight boxer who dethroned heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko 3 years ago in Germany.

Fury was a huge underdog but managed to win the fight and shock the world

- Since those 3 years, Fury went off the rails. Went into suicidal depression, ballooned up to 400lbs and abused drugs and alcohol. Came very close to killing himself

- [Deontay Wilder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontay_Wilder) becomes WBC heavyweight champion - has all KO wins but is criticized for fighting tomato cans. However he slowly begins to prove himself as a legitimate puncher

- Fury comes out of retirement and [decides to fight Deontay Wilder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontay_Wilder_vs._Tyson_Fury). He manages to cut down from 400lbs to 260lbs yet enters the fight a 25-1 underdog

- Yet Fury dances around Wilder, schools him and is winning on the scorecards to the surprise of everyone. He gets knocked down in the 9th round but gets up quickly, proceeds to carry on as normal but then in the 12th round he is hit and suffers a a VERY serious knockdown, his head hits the canvas clean...and pretty much everyone at this point believes Wilder has won (even Wilder himself celebrates), yet Fury gets up at the 9th second...somehow...pretty much the same way Adonis Creed does in the first Creed film.

- [Fury gives his £8 million purse to charity](https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/boxing/tyson-fury-donate-entire-8m-13676994)

The fight results in a draw (which many believe is shocking and corrupt)...what I couldn't help but notice is that this fight seems MORE like a movie than real life, one day this could make a great fucking film.

Movies featuring Kevin Bacon make more money and have higher critical scores when his characters have two or more collegiate degrees. The more degrees of Kevin Bacon the better!,movies,555,a2e6d6,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/a2e6d6/movies_featuring_kevin_bacon_make_more_money_and/,52,2018-12-02 10:41:28," 

In honor of Kevin Bacon and his illustrious career, I decided to look into his filmography to see if his movies are better when his characters have collegiate degrees. Why? Everyone loves the “[**Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon**](https://www.npr.org/2012/09/14/161130024/the-history-of-six-degrees-of-kevin-bacon)” game so I decided to take it a step further and see if his movies had better Tomatometer scores when his characters were highly educated. As always, please don’t expect correlation, causation or world changing calculations. Just sit back, relax and enjoy the dumb data about smart Kevin Bacon characters.

The data set includes 51 movies (37 total degrees) and I did my best to make sure no degree, certificate or certification went unnoticed. Since a lot of these characters are fictional, and the movies don’t spend a lot of time on his collegiate (or beyond) education, I had to make educated guesses for several movies like *Crazy, Stupid, Love, Cop Car, The River Wild* and *The Darkness.* The good news is I’m very happy with my conclusions and went into the data gathering with no assumptions or theories, which means I didn’t try to pepper my Bacon results with unwarranted collegiate degrees.

Here are the results!

**Kevin Bacon movies where he has 0 degrees**

* **Tomatometer Score – 58%**
* **Domestic Box Office (inflated) – $85 million**
* **Total Movies - 26**

There are 26 movies in this section and features Bacon as a student (*Footloose*), criminal (*Murder in the First*) or handy man who is great at battling subterranean monsters (*Tremors*).  The 58% overall score isn’t bad, with movies like *JFK* (83%), *Animal House* (91%) and *The Woodsman* (88%) doing the heavy lifting.

The most notable aspect of this category is his history of villainous characters or convicts. Movies like *The River Wild, Sleepers, Super, Trapped, JFK, Murder in the First* showcase the various ways Bacon can play squirrely and you need to check out James Gunn’s *Super,* because he makes some interesting decisions.

Also, if you get a chance check out *Jayne Mansfield’s Car*. Billy Bob Thornton directed it and it stars Bacon, Robert Duvall, John Hurt, Robert Patrick, Ray Stevenson and Frances O’Conner. The movie got zero theatrical play but there is enough in it to make a watch worthwhile.

&#x200B;

 **Kevin Bacon movies where he has 1 degree**

* **Tomatometer Score – 43%**
* **Domestic Box Office (inflated) – $50 million**
* **Total Movies - 17**

This category has the lowest Tomatometer average of the three because of *R.I.P.D., Death Sentence, Quicksilver, The Air Up There, The Darkness* and *Criminal Law*. None of these movies have a critical score above 31% and if it wasn’t for *Frost/Nixon, Cop Car* and *Mystic River* the overall score would’ve been much worse.

This category helped me realize that Kevin Bacon has played a lot of cops, detectives or FBI agents throughout his storied filmography. If you get a chance check out *Cop Car* because Bacon is fantastic in it and I loved every second of him running around like a maniac. Also, I think his *Mystic River* performance is underrated and didn’t get enough respect because everyone focused on the scenery chewers around him.

&#x200B;

 **Kevin Bacon movies where he has 2 or more degrees**

* **Tomatometer average – 64%**
* **Domestic Box Office (inflated) – $177 million**
* **Total Movies - 8**

This section has the highest Tomatometer score and box office because of *Apollo 13 (95%), A Few Good Men (82%),* *Patriot’s Day (81%), X-Men: First Class (86%)* and *Black Mass (73%).* Bacon isn’t the main character in any of them, but having him around certainly helps because he has no problem holding his own alongside Tom Cruise, Johnny Depp or Tom Hanks.

I love that his two twisted scientist characters in *Hollow Man* and *X-Men: First Class* are named Sebastian. If you are going to watch one of them, stay away from *Hollow Man* because it isn’t Paul Verhoeven’s best and there is nothing likable about Bacon’s character. I tried to watch it again for research, but I couldn’t make it all the way through because the movie has not aged well.

If you get a chance check out *Taking Chance.* It features a very understated performance from Bacon and is worth a watch.

The more degrees the better! There are outliers like *Tremors* and *The Woodsman*, but the data proves that Kevin Bacon movies featuring him with multiple degrees are appreciated more by critics. You are welcome world.

Explaining Plot Holes in The Dark Knight Rises,movies,5,a2rhql,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/a2rhql/explaining_plot_holes_in_the_dark_knight_rises/,53,2018-12-03 13:36:51,"Time and again whenever there is discussion of The Dark Knight Rises, I see three specific plot holes that people constantly bring up:

* How does Bruce manage to get back to Gotham after escaping the Pit?

* How does his broken back magically heal?

* How is he able to walk and fight with no cartilage in his knee?

First, let's address how Bruce gets back to Gotham. In the movie, there is a scene in which Lucius says that the bomb will go off in 23 days. A few minutes later, we see Bruce escaping the Pit. When he shows up in the city, he tells Selina that the bomb will go off tomorrow. This means it can be reasonably assumed he had three weeks (give or take a couple of days) to escape the Pit and return to Gotham.

As for how he gets back to Gotham, remember in Batman Begins that Bruce is able to travel around the world all by himself with no money and no resources to learn the ways of a criminal. This is also before he gets trained by the League of Shadows and learns how to become ""invisible"" and sneak around undetected. With this in mind, Bruce could very easily have snuck on to a boat or plane that would have taken him closer to the city no matter where the Pit actually was.

As for how Bruce physically gets into Gotham, remember that earlier in the movie we see that some Special Forces soldiers managed to sneak into Gotham through the food trucks that were continuing to supply the city. Bruce could've easily used the same method, especially given his training by the League of Shadows mentioned above.

Another way he could've gotten into Gotham is by walking across the ice undetected. We see later in the film that he is able to balance himself on it without falling through, not to mention this could also be a callback to Batman Begins when Ra's al Ghul trains him on how to have ""sure footing"" on the ice.

[IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1345836/faq?ref_=tt_faq_sm) offers a third, more subtle explanation:

> He used the Bat to get on the islands since it was last parked in the Bat-cave when Bruce left Gotham and then seen draped over on a roof top in the island when he returned. Wayne Manor is outside the Gotham's islands (and on the U.S. mainland). In The Dark Knight, Harvey wondered if the manor is in city limits and Bruce said it is in the Palisades, which is considered withing the city by jurisdiction. Harvey asked this probably since the Palisades is not in the islands of Gotham. In the Gotham map that appeared in the film's viral marketing online game The Fire Rises (not to be confused with the the strike-zone Gotham map in another viral marketing site), the manor and Palisades is outside the islands and on the mainland. This fact is important since we saw, in the film, Bane blow up the bridges connecting the islands with the mainland. AT the end of the film, nothing suggests that Wayne Manor was looted or attacked by Bane's men or criminals.

In regards to Bruce's back, many people assume that it is broken since that's how it's depicted in the comics. But unless I am mistaken, the film never actually says that Bane broke Bruce's back. In fact, it implies that his back has been dislocated when the prisoner tells him he has a protruding vertebra and forces it back in. 

Furthemore, according to [MedlinePlus](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000443.htm), even if his back had been broken, it wouldn't have mattered:

> Most compression fractures due to injury heal in 8 to 10 weeks with rest, wearing of a brace, and pain medicines.

Granted, Bruce didn't have a back brace or pain medication, but he was in the Pit for about 4 to 5 months. I think that's plenty of time for his back to heal, regardless of whether it was dislocated or broken.

Now for his knee. Bruce having no cartilage in the knee means that he has osteoarthritis. That doesn't mean he can't walk, it just means it's painful for him to do so. IMDb goes into more detail: 

> Bruce's leg may or may not have the brace still on since we never see him without the trousers in the Pit. We are to assume Bane left it on, since he thought Bruce couldn't escape. Nevertheless, if Bruce didn't have it, then he walked with the pain. No cartilage in the knee means he has osteoarthritis in the knee and that causes painful, stiff joints—not inability to walk); Bruce in the beginning of the film was still able to jump out of the hospital room in one scene and dance with Selina in another before the scene when he got the knee brace.

True, this explanation isn't perfect, as the movie does seem to just drop the subject without any further mention of it. But it's hardly the most unrealistic thing in the movie, especially when you're talking about a guy who is more motivated than ever to take back his city. Having all that adrenaline meant that he could easily have overcome the pain.

Am I reaching with these explanations? Maybe. Could the movie have done a better job of explaining these issues? Almost certainly. But regardless, I would argue that none of these are truly plot holes, since they fit with the internal logic of the trilogy.

If I missed anything or got something wrong, please feel free to correct me.

TL;DR: Bruce had three weeks to get back to Gotham and could have used his training in stealth to sneak onboard the food trucks supplying the city, or walked across the ice undetected. Bruce's back is implied to have been dislocated rather than broken and given how he's in the Pit for months, it's reasonable to assume that that's more than enough time for it to heal. His knee having no cartilage just means that it is painful for him to exert it, not that he can't move or walk on it.

There's a scene where this guy and girl are rock climbing up a face of rock. All of the sudden, the rope goes slack and the knowing that something happened to her guide up top, she immediately whips out a knife, saws through the climbing rope and drops to the ground. After she lands and is stunned for a tiny bit, you see her legs go tense and she is immediately dragged backwards. She tries to grab hold on the ground but fails.

A bit later in the movie, you see a guy driving down an interstate, and there is tons of traffic. He inserts a CD into the audio player and he starts to listen. He says something along the lines of ""What is all this traffic about"" and immediately, multiple ambulances roar by. He groans

Later, the guy in the car realizes that he's going to be late to his meeting or whatever, and he pulls off to an old gas station and says where is the payphone. There's an older man that is very dirty and has only half of his teeth that doesn't say anything, but he points to a broken down phone that looks incredibly old and smiles wickedly.

That's all I remember about the actual scenes but the movie art, from what I remember has a girl hanging by one arm off a cliff. Not sure about this last part, but the movie might have had the word ""fall"" in the title.

A cast made of over a dozen hollywood legends, a realistic depiction of the Wehrmacht, the Germans speak completely in German (with subtitles), and it's not a happy ending which sets it apart from a majority of war movies. My one complaint would have to be that it's 3 hours long.

Michael Clarke Duncan's character, John, was sent to prison for a crime he didn't commit or a small crime that was landed him unjustly in jail. Tom Hanks' character, Paul, works as a guard and has been passive or reserved about racism going on in the world around him. Through getting to know John, Paul learns that all men are created equal and fights to save John from the death sentence. It would be based on true events or highly committed to setting the tone for the era. The movie teaches us an important lesson about racism, equality, and sympathy for people in less-than-favorable circumstances.

*What I learned after watching the movie:*

Paul and (surprisingly) David Morse's character, Brutus, were already sensible, sympathetic, and respectful prison guards for the death row block. Paul can't urinate, gets healed by John (who is apparently Jesus or something) and spits out a swarm of bees.

There is some guard cruelty but only really one guard and he's just a psycho and HOLY SHIT ABOUT THE DRY SPONGE. wow. WOOOOOW.

I did NOT expect all the supernatural elements about the movie and only after I saw it was based on a Stephen King novel, I realized why.

**The right stuff** \- About start of the space race from the US point of view. The movie is at its best when it focuses on the technical aspect of the program or the Mercury 7 astronauts who were pretty fun to watch (even though, I think 2 of them didn’t get any dialogue). The problem is the movies is 3 hours and 13 minutes long and the first 49 minutes are about the guy (Chuck Yeager) who broke the sound barrier. Yeager plays no part in the movie at all after the start; he pops up now and again so we can see that he’s following the astronauts progress over the radio and TV, but then again so is the rest of the world. He's inclusion is, at best, as footnote of the technological advancement of the US. Sure the movie plays him up as this big important guy (he closes the movie out) and from Roger Ebert's review I guess he was a very important US pilot; apparently modern pilots try to model their voices after his when they talk over the incerom. Even so, he doesn't interact with any of the astronauts in any meaningful way. At most he seems regretful that he declined the NASA job, which I guess is something, but I’m sure so was every other pilot at the time. 5/10

**First man** \- About Neil Armstrong’s Moon mission. It's like “The right stuff” but minus the charismatic performances. There are 3 fight scenes and they are all pretty good and the Moon itself was great, if too short. Gosling's moment on the Moon was great (and I’m a fan of his, and I’m sure the director is just as responsible) he’s performance as Armstrong is very bad. Zero life. They might as well have painted a smiley face on a piece of cardboard and voiced it over, for all the difference that would make. I get that he is sad over his family loss, but still, he gives nothing. You’d figure he’d be able to at least crack a smile at least once, during any of his successes, but nope. However, I could totally see Corey Stoll growing into the Buzz that KOs any Moon truther that get in his face. 4/10

That does it  for the NASACU. Willems also included Hidden figures and while I did like it (8/10), I have no interest in watching it again.

**Space cowboys** \- An old Soviet satellite is going down and the only one that can read its code is the guy who wrote it 40 years ago: Clint Eastwood. This is just so much fun. It’s a great cast of veteran actors (not just Eastwood, but also Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland and James Garner), you just don't see in action adventure movies. Everyone is great (Sutherland is a ladies man is hilarious), but I have never seen Tommy Lee Jones so alive. His scenes with Eastwood are perfect in every way, and so is his send off at the end. Sadly, while the end does have a nice reveal, Sutherland, Garner and the rest of the cast are a bit forgotten, and don't have anything to do. 9/10

**Lockout** \- Guy Pearce has to rescue the president's daughter from a space prison. You would think that it would be hard for them to not make that interesting...well they found a way. Pearce is the only solid thing here, his Snake Plissken rip off delivers in every scene. Joseph Gilgun (Cassidy the vampire from the show “Preacher”) plays crazy well, it’s just that he’s never given anything to focus his crazy on (there is the president's daughter, but he never actively goes after her). He just sits in the control room and makes noises and shoots hostages. Also Peter Stormare and Morgan from the Walking dead’s roles are fun, for what they are. 2/10",False,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Adonis's heavyweight weight is listed as 214lbs whereas Mason Dixon from Rocky Balboa was listed as 225lbs in that film.

We see that Drago Jr was knocking everyone out like a beast, however Mason Dixon was also knocking everyone out. Before he fought Rocky, he was 33-0 with all wins coming by knockouts. He didn't destroy them outright like Drago Jr but he still knocked them out. He was knocking out the top contenders just like Drago Jr was. The only reason Old Rocky gave him a good fight was because he underestimated him and broke his hand while fighting him.

In fact, I wonder how Adonis Creed would fare against Rocky's opponents now that he is a heavyweight. Adonis Creed against:

"'Widows' is far and away my favorite movie of 2018 so far, but I have reservations with its important backstory",movies,0,a2sx49,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/a2sx49/widows_is_far_and_away_my_favorite_movie_of_2018/,14,2018-12-03 15:58:20,"Hi all,

Saw 'Widows' over the weekend and GODDAMN. It's a shame that such a great movie with superior filmmaking at its helm and a lot of crowd-pleasing moments seems to have gone under the GA's radar. I want to blame its lackluster marketing, which seemed coy about highlighting its triumph as a slow-burn, character-driven crime movie rather than the derivative and high-octane thriller with STRONG WOMEN it was sold as -- but who knows. This will definitely find an audience over time. 

I'm from Chicago and found its portrayal of the city to be great. It highlights its standard hallmarks but also displays some of its unique locations and harsh socioeconomic truths in a way that hasn't been done beyond a small handful of movies. 

That said, I am struggling with the flashback that reveals Marcus, the only son of Liam Neeson's and Viola Davis's characters was murdered by a cop in a tragic misreading. I found the movie's portrayal of different social and economic classes and consequences among the characters to work very well as organic aspects to the story since they're contextualized and developed within several plotlines, but this particular instance felt a bit out of scope and it gives way to several potential small holes in the movie.

We learn that Marcus's death caused their marriage to fall apart and subsequently gave Neeson motivation to fake his death, but Marcus's murder still felt oddly inconsequential. How did his death not become a huge media event? How do none of the Mulligan characters ever bring this up -- there's no way that the murder wouldn't have been a huge controversy and hot topic in the city, and possible come up in conversation with her or in private when discussing her or her husband/family. Information on Marcus's murder comes and goes very quickly that feels notably underwritten with regard to many aspects of the story and the manner of his death. Parts of me think it is a cheap and slightly disingenuous way to quickly wrap up the movie's important backstory by engaging/manipulating with audiences' sympathies on an important social issue rather than give it the same portrayal and development of other socioeconomic topics the movie touches on. 

Curious to head others' thoughts on this aspect of the movie. Goes without saying police brutality is a serious topic and doesn't have to be portrayed in a didactic way or be the main plotline of a movie for it to be portrayed successfully, but its inclusion in 'Widows' has been rubbing me wrong since I saw it over the weekend. Maybe my mind will change during future viewings.",False,0.4939,0.0,0.802,0.198
Maleficent (1959 cartoon) thoughts,movies,8,a2jn7w,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/a2jn7w/maleficent_1959_cartoon_thoughts/,7,2018-12-02 20:26:43," Video I was watching: https://youtu.be/8RF56gn5tNA

I just realized after all these years that they aged Maleficent. I used to vaguely wonder why she looked different in the subsequent years after Aurora's birth, and now I finally see it. Masterful drawing and creativity right here. They even make it appear that she is less green-skinned and more blue-grey, in addition to the slightly changed features. Maleficent was quite pretty when we are first introduced to her, but here she looks worn - tired out. Her eyes look a bit sagged and she is a little slumped over. I wonder if it is because it took so long to find Aurora and the hate was aging her? Maybe because she had nothing else to go on/live for?

I don't remember 'Sleeping Beauty' ever addressing what Maleficent was up to in that 16 year interval that Aurora was growing up in, so one could assume she kind of retired and went away, waiting and pining away for the day she would be able to get her revenge.

This now makes me wonder even more about her back story. Yes, she promised to kill a child/young adult because she wasn't invited to the birth celebration, but I would be remiss if I didn't ponder what Maleficent's reaction would've been had she been invited? And what had she done to be ignored and not receive an invitation in the first place? She's a mistress of evil but the movie never gave details on her crimes other than being DISLIKED enough to not be invited to a party and being snuffed out by the Fairies.

This is why I dislike Angelina Jolie's 'Maleficent' and feel cheated; that film did not address - in any way, shape, or form - any of the questions I have just posed and have been lingering on for years. Sure Angelina's film had parts that should serve as answers for me but that film was a COMPLETE reimagining the of 1959 film and therefore I do not consider it canon.",False,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Still a great movie, but it's a little hard to watch since we're spoiled with detailed CGI animated movies of today. With the Lion King animated remake on the way with photo realism and the new Toy Story movie coming out, I really wouldn't mind if Pixar did a cash grab of ""remastering"" their old movies with updated textures, animation, and lighting.
