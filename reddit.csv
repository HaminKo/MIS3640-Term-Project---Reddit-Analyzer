(Possibly) quitting Python Development after 2 years of non stop learning.

Just hit me now. I've wasted so much time it feels

I'd appreciate advice. Though, I certainly don't expect it or feel entitled to it.

I've worked on web app projects,
Networking, pen testing, web scraping/data analysis, GUI development, and MANY more.

I just can't finish a damn project. I've been learning entirely on my own. I can honestly say I've received zero assistance apart from help on minor bugs. 

I've never spoken a word in person to anyone on the subject of programming. With so many beggars, I just refuse to be that guy milking it and pissing people off looking for handouts.

So, I get hours and hours deep into a project and just end up spinning my wheels for dozens of hours until something  else catches my interest. And repeat. 

I've learned a shit ton, but nothing specifically in depth because I refuse to settle for some simple GUI app that scrapes weather data. Networking particularly has been my focus. It's been where I've put most of my work in. But I've been ALL over.

If I'm going to continue, I need to be on a team dedicated and driven toward building something. Development and learning the ropes has been my life for 2 years. I'm the hardest worker I know.

So, if anyone is looking for someone to collaborate with on something real, feel free to send me a message. I'd love to be a part.

How to Install Jupyter Notebook on AWS EC2 Instance for Machine Learning and Python scripting,Python,15,a3o47y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/a3o47y/how_to_install_jupyter_notebook_on_aws_ec2/,11,2018-12-06 08:56:51,"In  this Post I will discuss on How to Install Jupyter Notebook on  AWS EC2  Instance for Machine Learning and Python scripting as well  installing  boto3 for using powerful AWS libraries.

As in real life Machine Learning / Deep Learning are very   memory/compute intensive processes those cannot be supported by a   standalone desktop. In these cases we can leverage on cloud and choose a   server which is having right CPU/GPU for processing huge data. For  this  post i have chosen a micro server so  as anyone can launch and  learn as well it costs less / free for those  who are within one year of  free tier eligibility.

What we will do:

1) Launch an EC2 instance -micro.

2) Small change to default security group to allow Jupyter Notebook access ec2 instance via browser.

3) Installing Anaconda.

4) Configuring jupyter.

5) Installing boto3, AWS package

6) Launching jupyter notebook from browser, by connecting to EC2 server.

Assume you already aware of how to Launch a new EC2 instance. If not please check [here](https://awsontop.com/index.php/how-to-start-my-first-ec2-instance-part1/) remember to change the security group as below.

Quart (Flask wrapper) is not separating different requests into different contexts,Python,0,a3pbjh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/a3pbjh/quart_flask_wrapper_is_not_separating_different/,2,2018-12-06 11:13:04," Hi, all.

I've made an API using Quart, due to the asynchronous nature of the backend code I have (Flask doesn't work with that). It works fine if I make a request and wait for it to finish, then do another. However, it gets a terrible bug if I make two or more requests simultaneously (don't need to start them exactly at the same time), which is the following: instead of separating the two requests into different contexts, they run in the same event loop, hence a conflict happens and the response is widely affected.

First I thought it was due to some global variables I've had, but then I got rid of them and nothing changed. The whole system is a scraper. Here are some important bits of the API construction:

    app = Quart(__name__) 
    @app.route('/scrape/<string:cnpj>', methods=['GET']) 
    async def index(cnpj):
         ...

# About the project

[CEF Python](https://github.com/cztomczak/cefpython) is a an open source project founded by Czarek Tomczak in 2012 to provide Python bindings for the [Chromium Embedded Framework](https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef). Simply put, CEF is kind of [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) for Python, but with numerous use cases making it a lot more. The project has evolved and it is now much more than just pure Python bindings, it helps you integrate the CEF framework with the Python environment, the desktop and the numerous Python GUI frameworks and tools such as [PyQt](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt), [wxPython](https://wxpython.org/), [PyGTK](http://www.pygtk.org/), [PyGObject](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/PyGObject), [Tkinter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter), [Kivy](http://kivy.org/), [Panda3D](http://www.panda3d.org/), [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/), [PyOpenGL](http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/), [PyWin32](https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32), [PySide](https://wiki.qt.io/PySide), [PyInstaller](http://www.pyinstaller.org/) and [PySDL2](https://github.com/marcusva/py-sdl2).

The Chromium project focuses mainly on Google Chrome application development while CEF focuses on facilitating embedded browser use cases in third-party applications. Lots of applications use CEF control, there are more than [100 million CEF instances](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_Embedded_Framework#Applications_using_CEF) installed around the world.

There are numerous use cases for CEF:

1. Embed a web browser widget in a classic Qt / GTK / wxPython desktop application
2. Use it as a modern HTML5 based rendering engine that can act as a replacement for classic desktop GUI frameworks. Think of it as [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) for Python.
3. Render web content off-screen in applications that use custom drawing frameworks
4. Use it for automated testing of web applications with more advanced capabilities than [Selenium](https://www.seleniumhq.org/) web browser automation due to CEF low level programming APIs
5. Use it for web scraping, as a web crawler or other kind of internet bots

# The project is seeking sponsors - please spread the word!

The CEF Python project is seeking companies to help make the project even greater than it is today. There is a lot that can be done for the project such as monthly releases with latest Chromium version, an automated build system, more CEF API exposed (only about 50% is exposed so far), more examples and snippets, easier integration with popular GUI toolkits in just a few lines of code, and the many proposals for new features submitted in the issue tracker (H264/H265 codecs support in build tools, multi-threaded support, hundreds of new settings, et al.). If your company would like to sponsor CEF Python development efforts then please contact [Czarek](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17xmoT5Z_zTHkVclqPzrs2aAV64Uiu7fh/view). Long term sponsorships are welcome and Czarek is open to ideas about the project. He would love to spend more time on developing this project, but he can't afford doing so in his free time. Currently there is no company supporting this project actively on a day to day basis.

Connect Four AI,Python,1,a3m7l7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/a3m7l7/connect_four_ai/,2,2018-12-06 03:43:09,"# Basis

So this isn't me asking for help for a Connect Four AI. I have that down and I believe I made my life even easier.The basis of this is to help others who may be trying to make a smart AI in Python but want it to run fast.I do not know if this has been done before so I can't say I absolutely am the first to make it up.Nonetheless, I'll describe what I've done.

# Background

So for the past 2 months, I've been developing a Discord bot written in Python. I have a few mini-games in it and I eventually added Connect Four into it. Now it doesn't have the smartest AI but it's still better than just choosing random columns to go in and hope for the best. I then wanted to push myself further to try to anticipate at least 4 moves ahead. That ended up being far too slow as it was analyzing 2,401 possible futures. So I brought it down to 3; faster, but still too slow. As of right now, it's only analyzing 2 moves ahead; the AI's and the player's. It will avoid going somewhere that a player needs a piece to go to in order to win. It will also analyze and see if it can win itself or if it can block a player's win.

# Idea

Now I remembered that a standard 7x6 Connect Four board has 7^(42) (approx. 3.11 x 10^(35)) possible game boards in existence. Some of those game boards cannot actually be reached only because there would *have* to be a winning game prior to it. So I decided to use some math, some recursion, and a little bit of visualization to develop what I've just developed.

# Process

If every board can be represented using an `int` then that means that we have to lay out the possible game boards using a simple Complete N-ary Tree. For those of you who don't know what that is, a Complete N-ary Tree is when all *nodes* of a tree can follow a simple math equation to figure out where its children nodes are and where its parent nodes are. [Here](https://www.techtud.com/short-answer-question/complete-n-ary-tree-tree-which-each) is an example of one. 

For the following: *n* = n-ary tree size; *p* = parent node value; *c* = child node value; *l* = specific node location

To calculate a child node's location given the parent value and n-ary tree size:

*c = np + l*

To calculate a parent node's location given a child node (with a specific location) and the n-ary tree size:

*p = (c - l) / n*

Now that we know these, we can map out possible game boards.

# Code

First, we're going to need a `ConnectFour` class to hold the values of the board and to add pieces to the board.

    class ConnectFour:
        def __init__(self, column):
    
            # True signifies that the User has their piece there.
            # False signifies that the AI has its piece there.
            # None signifies that the spot is open.
            self._board = [
                [None, None, None, None, None, None, None],
                [None, None, None, None, None, None, None],
                [None, None, None, None, None, None, None],
                [None, None, None, None, None, None, None],
                [None, None, None, None, None, None, None],
                [None, None, None, None, None, None, None]
            ]
            
            # Keep track of whether or not it is the AIs turn
            self._ai_turn = False
    
            self.addPiece(column)
        
        def addPiece(self, column):
            last = -1
            
            # Iterate through rows to find the lowest open-spot
            for row in range(len(self._board)):
                if self._board[row][column] == None:
                    last = row
                else:
                    break
            
            # Only add the piece if an open column was found or if the column was not -1
            # The column being -1 will be explained in the next code block
            if last != -1 and column != -1:
                self._board[last][column] = not self._ai_turn
                self._ai_turn = not self._ai_turn

Now that that's out of the way, we can head into our recursive method that actually calculates the board.

    def calculateBoard(identifier):
        
        # Get the tree (parent node) and the variant (child node) of the current identifier
        tree = identifier // 7
        variant = (identifier - 1) % 7
        # The reason we subtract 1 from the identifier before getting the variant
        # is because we want to signify that the identifer 1 is when the player goes in the first column
        # during their first move
        # It also means that the identifer of 0 is an empty game board
        
        # If the identifier is 0, give it an empty game board
        if identifer <= 0:
            return ConnectFour(-1)
        
        # If the identifier is between 1 and 7, it is the first move
        # This is also the base case
        elif identifier <= 7:
            return ConnectFour(variant)
        
        # This is the recursive case. It handles for every identifier after 7
        else:
            board = calculateBoard(tree)
            board.addPiece(variant)
            return board

# Conclusion

Now this code is just the basic code you need to calculate each and every game board that exists in Connect Four. What's nice about this code is that the time complexity is *log (base 7) m* where *m* = the total number of moves made.",False,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

I'm trying to create a simple text based game for a semester project in a python class.

path(1) or path1()  #and id have a function to go along with that and if path == 1 it will run the path 1 function

Currently working on a project that revolves heavily around websockets and realtime. To that end, I am using asyncio with aiohttp. 

As with most projects, there comes a time where the question of databases arises. Due to the realtime requirements, blocking during database access is not acceptable. Obviously being able to abstract away the various SQL dialects is desirable, and an ORM is a way to solve this. There are a number of projects that aim to bring ORMs to asyncio, chiefly:

- [tortoise-orm](https://github.com/tortoise/tortoise-orm): built from the ground up using pypika query generator, supports sqlite, pg, mysql
- [GINO](https://github.com/fantix/gino): an async ORM on top of sqlalchemy core, supports pg
- [sqlalchemy-aio](https://github.com/RazerM/sqlalchemy_aio): an async strategy for sqlalchemy that delegates io to a separate thread, supports sqlite, pg, mysql, more

I'm keen to hear how other asyncio projects have handled database access and perhaps peoples experiences with the above projects or recommendations of others. ORM, plain SQL, something in between?

edit: added which dbs each supports

#### Result
The consensus at this point seems to be that native asyncio ORMs are still very immature (what a surprise). For now, given sqlalchemy-aio only implements core, and tortoise orm is pre 1.0, I think GINO may be the best choice.

That said, it seems common to just execute the queries directly as well.",False,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

When we saved the original .SLDDRW file it is assigned a unique drawing number by our solidworks pdm vault.

Having trouble calling methods in API via XMLRPC via python,Python,0,a35c5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/a35c5t/having_trouble_calling_methods_in_api_via_xmlrpc/,6,2018-12-04 16:52:32,"I'm trying to connect to an API that has very little documentation.

It has Soap v1 and v2 interfaces as well as an XMLRPC interface.

I have tried sending a simple login request using zeep, which fails when using both SOAP endpoints, as only an error of invalid XMl is returned.

The XML that gets sent and received is:

`zeep.transports: Loading remote data from:` [`https://www.example.com/api/v2_soap/?wsdl`](https://www.example.com/api/v2_soap/?wsdl)

`zeep.transports: HTTP Response from` [`https://www.example.com/index.php/api/v2_soap/index/`](https://www.example.com/index.php/api/v2_soap/index/) `(status: 500):`

When I connect with XMLRPC to using svc.system.listMethods() the following is returned:

`['system.listMethods', 'system.methodHelp', 'system.methodSignature', 'system.multicall', 'handlePhpError', 'startSession', 'endSession', 'login', 'call', 'multiCall', 'resources', 'resourceFaults', 'globalFaults']`

When I connect via Soap v1 using python -mzeep wsdlURL, I get the same list of methods available.

However, when I connect via Soap v2 using python -mzeep, I get a much larger list of methods, such as catalog\_product.info which takes a sessionID and a product number as parameters.

My problem is in trying to use any of the methods returned via Soap v2 version of the WSDL seems impossible when they take a paramter.

So, I can do something like using catalog\_category.tree which is a method returned via the SOAP v2 WSDL:

`temp =` [`svc.call`](https://svc.call)`(session, 'catalog_category.tree')`

Which works and returns a dict in python, as catalog\_category.tree takes no parameters.

But when I try to use catalog\_product.info which does take parameters, I have been unable to do so.

I've tried the following attempts:

`temp =` [`svc.call`](https://svc.call)`(session, ""catalog_product.info"", session, 'prodid')`

and

`temp = svc.catalog_product.info(session, 'prodid')`

and

`temp = svc.system.catalog_product.info(session, 'prodid')`

Whatever I try results in an error (each different). 

So, to be clear, how can I call a method that is returned in the WSDL for Soap v2 via XMLRPC?

Potential bug in CPython that leads to segfault,Python,0,a33bfy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/a33bfy/potential_bug_in_cpython_that_leads_to_segfault/,10,2018-12-04 13:25:51,"I believe I may have found a bug in CPython that is baffling to say the least. If you've been on r/programmerhumor and/or r/programmertil in the last day, there's a chance you may have seen this. I've been benchmarking different fibonacci algorithms to get a good idea of which one has the best time complexity, when I got a segmentation fault. I started documenting my debugging attempts within the file, [found here](https://github.com/jungal01/odds-and-ends/blob/master/fibonacci.py). I suggest taking a peek at it because some info will be there and not mentioned at all here.

I first discovered this when trying to run the algo on 100,000 with the expectation that it would take a while and be an absolutely massive number, and instead got a segfault. Further testing to try to find the hard limit led me to find that there was no hard limit, but centered around 20,145. Errors also began in the other functions. The strangest part is, the segfault occurs on the recursive call, but I believe I proved in my testing that the recursion is not at fault, because the REPL can go far above and beyond the previously discovered limits, and if the memoized function runs, then so does the naive function.

At this point, I don't know how to continue testing, if I should submit a bug report, or where to even do so. I need help from more experienced bug chasers to continue testing this issue.

I have done 2 pieces of code that compress the ECG, however the results aren't great.

I'm trying to find a way to install python modules on a windows server in a secure environment that has remote access to devices but has no internet access.

Python was installed on the server by copying the installer and running it on the server.

I'm not able to install certain modules, as most of them take advantage of pip to install them.

Seems like pip needs an internet connection to fetch the data it needs.

For example, I need to install paramiko for an SSH client. The module itself and all the required dependencies all use pip. It's also more complicated, I'm guessing, that I'm installing on a windows server, where if it was Linux then it may be easier to copy files over.

Script for extracting URLs from chrome bookmarks export file.,Python,13,a2co30,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/a2co30/script_for_extracting_urls_from_chrome_bookmarks/,7,2018-12-02 06:56:50,"I've been collecting old synched bookmarks for years, encapsulating old bookmarks directories under an ""OLD"" folder every time I made a fresh start, which ended up in an endless chaotich list where finding something relevant is horribly tedious.

To solve that I thought about iterating over each bookmark: open each one and decide to change it's name or place it in a new clean folder structure if I want to keep it, or simply delete it.

The first step is exporting the bookmarks to an html file, which will be parsed to the list to be iterated as described above. The parsing depends on the browser and maybe version, and so far I've only written a very very simple one that seems to work for me with chrome ([this version](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2018/11/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_19.html) 64bits on windows).

The iteration will result in a new, clean, purged bookmarks structure that can be parsed again to html and imported back to the browser (only after cleaning the existing bookmarks, or you will just append the new clean list to the existing chaos).

&#x200B;

[Here](https://gist.github.com/P1tr0w/e89c265dbb79a92f1ad0143949249710) you can get and tinker with the little parser to get urls from a chrome bookmarks export file. I will add parsing for all the info chrome stores like name and last modified date, and something to parse the hierarchy to get the folder structure. Once the parser is completed I may work on the (de?)parser back to html, and then the simple cli script to iterate and manage each entry.

We originally wanted to tether everything to turtle, but I'm seeing online that won't be possible. So should we use canvas? This is what I was thinking.

    class Turtle_draw:
      def create_background(self, background_input):
        # Create canvas for turtle to write on 
        canvas = tk.Canvas(master =None, width = 500, height = 500)
        canvas.pack()
        wn = turtle.Screen()
        # Change background color
        if self.__background_input == ""yellow"":
          canvas.configure(background = ""yellow"")
        elif self.__background_input == ""white"":
          canvas.configure(background = ""white"")
        elif self.__background_input == ""light blue"":
          canvas.configure(background = ""light blue"")
        elif self.__background_input == ""light green"":
          canvas.configure(background = ""light green"")

I guess my question would be how to link the canvas, turtle and GUI all together. This is a snippet of our GUI code:

    # Create entry box for background color
    self.__background_input = Entry(self.__mid1, n = 10).grid(row = 1,column = 1)
    self.__background_input.bind(""<Return>"", self.__create_background))

and another part for the buttons:

    self.__a_cosine = Button(self.__mid3, text = 'ACosine',
                           command = self.create_axis2, self.acos_graph).grid(row = 4, column = 4)
    self.__a_cosine.config(font = (""Comic Sans"", 12))


I was thinking of having an ""create graph"" button at the bottom that launches the canvas and the graph - how can i do this?


Please pm me if you need more information as I can send you all of my files.

Thank you!

Hey guys

So I've been searching around and quite find an answer to the question: ""Are chemical or nuclear engineers employed in the IT world?"" The reason for my asking is that I am looking to move to IT as computers and software have always been a stronger suit for me but the engineering degrees have always been a promise of stable and reliable, well-paid work. As part of course I did complete some visual basic, excel and java coding but this was all pretty simple. What I would like to find out from you guys is whether engineers are employed for our strong analytical thinking and mathematical skills? As well as, where do I start looking? Is a diploma or certificate essential in moving to coding or is a portfolio of more worth? I look forward to hearing from you guys. :)",False,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

Next version of Masonite - v2.1 released! The Modern Python Web Framework,Python,37,a22z8t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/a22z8t/next_version_of_masonite_v21_released_the_modern/,11,2018-12-01 08:22:57,"# Introduction

Masonite 2.1 has been released! Masonite is an amazing MVC and **true** batteries included web framework.

For those familiar with 2.0, 2.1 changes how several classes are inherited in the application to assist in some of the challenges we saw hot fixing Masonite. It also improves some of the quirks with the framework that we noticed devs were doing.

## Testimonials and Feedback

Most developers who use the framework have really amazing things to say about it. Some of the feedback I have gotten over the past 6 months include:

**René Moser \[Nov 21st at 8:03 AM\]** ""really enjoying doing things in Masonite, finally I can make things real""

When choosing Masonite over Django for a bid for a development contract (which he won):

**Abram Isola \[Sep 20th at 1:55 PM\]** My deciding factors:

1. The application has to hook into an existing database with an existing schema AS WELL as manage a database of its own. This almost certainly knocks out Django because of its models. Using masonite allows me to use an ORM (Orator) that is flexible enough for me to access several different databases while managing the schema in only one of them. Huge time save.
2. The craft command allows me to generate (or write generators for) most of my code that I'll be doing for them. Huge time save.
3. Masonite's folder structure lends itself to the architecture that I've chosen for this project.
4. Masonite's release cycle make's it a safe choice for large companies. Upgrading can usually be automated with a simple script. Huge time save. (IDEA: We should build this into craft somehow.)
5. Masonite's flexible middleware allows me to very easily manage the levels of access controls that they want in a modular way.
6. Masonite's upload drivers allow me to manage the connections to their various upload services very easily.
7. I just wanted to do it because I like Masonite better than others

When talking about Masonite vs their current work software in Django:

**Dean Raemaekers \[Sep 17th at 11:24 AM\]** What I've built in Masonite so far can do some things that the actual official software can't do. And that was done in a few days.

and here are some others:

**Dean Raemaekers \[Sep 14th at 1:42 PM\]** I still like Django but Masonite just has more of a wow factor for me... It's new but it feels so mature

**Dean Raemaekers \[Sep 12th at 11:51 AM\]** Wow. I am finished the first part of the app that I wanted to write. That was really quick. Yes, Masonite makes projects quick to develop.

**Caleb Meyer \[Aug 20th at 5:26 PM\]** I've never written any laravel (PHP makes me shudder), but I've been doing ruby and rails for about 5 years now, and this is the first python framework that's made any sense from that perspective.

**Tony Hammack \[Aug 16th at 9:23 PM\]** I heard your talk on Podcast.**init** two days ago. I checked out Masonite yesterday, and I ported my Flask app over in under 30 min. It took me 6 hours of figuring out how to get my flask set up and refactor it to get to a production level.

Although I have gotten better at python, I have to say that this framework is the easiest I have ever worked with. The documentation is so darn helpful. The amount of useful code comments and docstrings is amazing. I hope other packages adopt this strategy. Great job!

## Features

Out of the box it has:

* An active record style ORM
* A companion scaffolding CLI tool
* A very explicit IOC container to manage application dependencies
* Built in support for many of the services we all need like Amazon s3 upload and disk support
* Built in support for websockets / Pusher support
* SMTP and Mailgun email support out of the box
* explicit use cases of design patterns. Most developers who use Masonite learn these design patterns and how they are used which naturally makes them learn design patterns in a practical sense and through example and real world scenarios
* Built in database seeding to very quickly seed data into your table
* Built in Queue support for queuing jobs with RabbitMQ and other queue services
* Nearly **600 pages** of extensive documentation.
* And a whooole lot more.

Masonite had an awesome time with the last 2.0 release in June and gained a bit of a following and some awesome contributing community members.

On a basic level, it's capable of producing at least 80% of the typical GUI problems that you would normally use Qt or tkinter to code.  The other 20% are the larger commercial-type applications that are not appropriate.

It can not only duplicate the look of most GUIs, it can duplicate the behaviors as well.  Want a dial widget to update a slider widget?  No problem. All of the typical widgets from the underlying GUI Framework (tkinter, Qt so far) are available for the user to program with.  The difference is in how the user interacts with those widgets.  Normally with Qt and tkinter, an Object Oriented design is used.  This is where the departure begins....

# PySimpleGUI Architecture

PySimpleGUI is a ""wrapper"" for tkinter and Qt, with more on the way.  Their are a number of ""tricks"" / architecture decisions that make this package appealing to both beginners and experienced GUI developers.  Both will appreciate the simplicity.  Simple doesn't mean shallow.  There is considerable depth to the PySimpleGUI architecture.

# What is it?

PySimpleGUI is a code-generator in many ways.  When you get and configure a ""Text Element (Widget)"", PySimpleGUI makes ***exactly*** the same tkinter or Qt calls that a developer would.

Here is part of the code that is executed when you create a Text Widget.

    element.QT_Label = qlabel = QLabel(element.DisplayText, toplevel_win.QTWindow)  
    if element.Justification is not None:  
        justification = element.Justification  
    elif toplevel_win.TextJustification is not None:  
        justification = toplevel_win.TextJustification  
    else:  
        justification = DEFAULT_TEXT_JUSTIFICATION  
    if justification[0] == 'c':  
        element.QT_Label.setAlignment(Qt.AlignCenter)  
    elif justification[0] == 'r':  
        element.QT_Label.setAlignment(Qt.AlignRight)  
    if not auto_size_text:  
        if element_size[0] is not None:  
            element.QT_Label.setFixedWidth(element_size[0])  
        if element_size[1] is not None:  
            element.QT_Label.setFixedHeight(element_size[1])

The ""beauty"" or PySimpleGUI is the code you see above was specified with this line of code

`Text('Text', justification='left', size=(20,1))`

You can see just how little effort it took to generate, and configure on your behalf, code that resembles hand-generated Qt code.

## Architectural Decisions / Direction / Goals

* Present a GUI interface that is not object oriented
* Run an event loop within the user's application
* Events (button clicks, keystrokes, menu choices, etc) are funneled through a single interface, Window.Read()
   * Users can use simple 'if' statements to act upon the GUIs events.... if this button press, do this.
   * There are no callbacks
* Can change a widget's settings is a single call
* Widget interaction is modeled simply, through simple widget updates
   * Change Widget A's value to value of Widget B is a single call
   * A widget's current value is returned in a dictionary when there is an event
* Can duplicate nearly any window layout created by coding directly in tkinter/Qt.
* Create complete documentation with a LOT of illustrations
* Don't try to solve all GUI problems.
   * Be the 80% of 80/20. Leave the difficult 20% to the major frameworks. The the other 80% of GUI problems.

This is the magic combination that is PySimpleGUI.  It's a unique design that is approachable and enjoyable to use.

# Window Definition

## Widgets (Elements in PySimpleGUI-speak)

Creating widgets and placing them into a window definition is done with a single object, named appropriately in a simple manner.  There are no ""Label"" widgets, but there is a ""Text"" one.

PySimpleGUI takes advantage of the Python named parameter feature.  Object calls and methods are loaded up with lots of potential parameters.  An IDE is a must.  Let's look at a Text widget.

    Text(text, size=(None, None),  auto_size_text=None, click_submits=None, relief=None, font=None, text_color=None, background_color=None, justification=None, pad=None, margins=None, key=None, tooltip=None)

There are 13 different values and settings that can be specified when creating a Text widget.  They are set when you create the widget, not several lines away.

The amount of code required to set those 13 values is certainly greater than 1 line of code per value.  Closer to 2 or 3.

Not only are you setting the visible settings for a Text widget, but you're setting some behaviors.  For example, `enable_events` will cause this Text widget to inform the application when someone clicks on the text.  In 1 parameter we've done the work of several lines of code dealing with callbacks.  Callbacks are not something PySimpleGUI have to deal with.  There are no callbacks.

## Defining a Window

Break a window can be broken down into rows like this:

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/3t9rybs0pc121.jpg

&#x200B;

Then stack row ""rows""up and you've got yourself a window.

If you were to break down the sketched out window into Widgets, you would get something like this: ""Filename"" Input Text, Browse for files Ok button, Cancel button

To create PySimpleGUI from this, you simply make a list for each row and put those lists together.

## Example Code - Simple Form-style Window

        import PySimpleGUI as sg
        
        layout = [[sg.Text('Filename')],      
                  [sg.Input(), sg.FileBrowse()],      
                  [sg.OK(), sg.Cancel()] ]      
          
        event, values = sg.Window('Get filename example').Layout(layout).Read()    

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/3msoiouxoc121.jpg

&#x200B;

Here is a complete program that will show the example window, get the values from the user.

That's all you need. It's ""simple"" after all.

Your `layout` is a visual representation of your window.  You can clearly see 3 rows of widgets being defined.   If you would like your text to be red, then your layout would look like this:

    layout = [[sg.Text('Filename', text_color='red')],  
              [sg.Input(), sg.FileBrowse()],  
              [sg.OK(), sg.Cancel()]]

# Event Loops

## Example Code - Window with Event Loop

The event loop in PySimpleGUI is where all the action takes place.  There are no callbacks in PySimpleGUI.  All of the code is located in 1 place, inside the loop.

Getting user input is achieved by calling Window.Read()

A typical call to Read: `event, values = sg.window.Read()`

`event` will be the event that happened.  values are all of the window's widgets current values, in dictionary format.

Adding an event loop to the previous example results in this code:

    import PySimpleGUI as sg  
      
    layout = [[sg.Text('Filename', text_color='red')],  
              [sg.Input(), sg.FileBrowse()],  
              [sg.OK(), sg.Cancel()]]  
      
    window = sg.Window('Get filename example').Layout(layout)  
      
    # The Event Loop  
    while True:  
        event, values = window.Read()  
        if event is None:  
            break

Within your event loop you take actions based on the event. Let's say you want to print whatever is in the input field when the user clicks the OK button.  The changed event loop is:

    # The Event Loop  
    while True:  
        event, values = window.Read()  
        if event is None:  
            break  
        if event == 'OK':  
            print(values[0])

For buttons, when they are clicked, they return their text as the event, or you can set a ""key"" that will be what it returned to you when the button is clicked.  Adding a key to our OK button is done by adding the `key` parameter to the `OK()` call.

`sg.OK(key='_OK BUTTON_')`

Now when the OK button is clicked, the event value will be `_OK BUTTON_`.

# Widget Interaction

## Reading a widget

Any time that an event happens, you are provided a dictionary containing all of your widget's values.`event, values = window.Read()`

The`values` return code is a dictionary of the widget's values.  Adding a `key` to the `Input` widget will cause that key to be what is used to ""loop up"" the value of that widget in the `values` variable.

If our `Input` widget was changed to have a key: `sg.Input(key='_INPUT_')`

Then the value for that input field can be obtained from the `values` variable.  The value of the Input widget in this case will be: `values['_INPUT_']`

## Changing a widget's value

Every widget has an `Update` method that will the widget's value or settings.

To update an widget, you must first get the object.  You can either save it in a variable when you create it or you can look up a widget by it's key.  Remember widgets are called Elements in PySimpleGUI.  To get the  Input Element in the previous example, you could call `Element` or `FindElement`.`window.Element(key)`

Once you have the element, then you can call the Update function: `window.Element(key).Update(value and settings)`

## Widget interaction

Building further on the `key` idea and Updating widgets, let's look at an example where the text 'Filename' is replaced by whatever you type in the input box.

The basic logic: If button == 'OK': change text to input field's value

    import PySimpleGUI as sg  
      
    layout = [[sg.Text('Filename', text_color='red', key='_TEXT_')],  
              [sg.Input(key='_INPUT_'), sg.FileBrowse()],  
              [sg.OK(key='_OK BUTTON_'), sg.Cancel()]]  
      
    window = sg.Window('Get filename example').Layout(layout)  
      
    # The Event Loop  
    while True:  
      event, values = window.Read()  
      if event is None:  
            break  
      if event == '_OK BUTTON_':  
            window.Element('_TEXT_').Update(values['_INPUT_'])

As you can see, the pseudo-code on the real code look very similar.

Note the statement `if event is None` is what catches the user clicking the X to close the window.  When the user does that, we want to exit the program by breaking from the event loop.

# Async Designs

Asynchronous designs are possible using PySimpleGUI.  To use async, add a `timeout` parameter to the `window.Read()` call.,

## Example

Let's say you wanted to make a GUI that displays your latest emails, checking every 30 seconds.  Rather than spin off a thread for the mail checker, run it within your GUI's event loop. Ideally we want the GUI to run as much as possible so that it's responsive.  This is how it's accomplished

    # The Event Loop  
    while True:  
        event, values = window.Read(timeout=30000)

If you don't want to GUI to delay at all then set timeout=0.  Setting timeout=0 will run in a completely non-blocked, async fashion.

# Wrap-up

The overall architecture was meant to enable someone to duplicate both the GUI at a  near-pixel-level and the behavior of a program written directly in the tkinter or Qt framework.  PySimpleGUI provides a way of interacting with the native widgets in a more Python-friendly, novice-user-friendly manner.  It is not meant for large, commercial applications.  Those types of applications are in the 20% not covered by PySimpleGUI.

## Portability

Both PySimpleGUI code and the PySimpleGUI package itself are highly portable.  Taking a PySimpleGUI application from tkinter to Qt requires changing the import from `import PySimpleGUI` to `import PySimpleGUIQt`.  That really is all that is typically required.

The PySimpleGUI module itself is highly portable too.  Porting from tkinter to Qt took 1 week to get all of the widgets up and running with their basic operations.

Up until this week I never had luck with any UI libraries like Tkinter, Qt, Kivy. I came to Python to get away from Object Oriented Languages (wrote Obj-C mainly before this). I posted a project on here with a decent terminal interface but I was told about PySimpleGUI and took a look into it. It's extremely easy to pick up and there are a load of documents available for it written by the dev. I went from not even being able to load a window in Tkinter reliably to making a loading screen, and full program in one night with PySimpleGUI. The developer is also actively developing a version that implements PySide2/Qt5. The code is almost identical except for some features in elements being changed due to how the two frameworks work. Either way if you want to use Tkinter or Qt and are having trouble working with classes I recommend taking a look at PySimpleGUI. It's very easy for a beginner to pick up and I thought I should share it since I constantly see people asking in the Python Discord about a good GUI framework for beginners. I also think this is a pretty underrated project that could turn into a very easy way for anybody to create a GUI!

Intermittently, for a couple of, seemingly random from time to time, tests, I get a failure:

> requests.exceptions.ConnectionError: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='pr-5fdb8ad6.dev.dporganizer.com', port=8001): Max retries exceeded with url: /users/login (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.VerifiedHTTPSConnection object at 0x7feb677b1be0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno -2] Name does not resolve'))

Now I know the app is running and is accessible, because the other tests work fine (they all hit the same endpoint).

I also have a little function that runs before any tests, that makes sure that the app is accessible via all of AWS name servers (for our domain).

So, I figured I would look into urllib3's Retry object and logic, to at least solve the symptoms - since troubleshooting this is a nightmare given all the moving parts.

You might like a long-term project I try to build. It is a
datavisualization that aims to cluster movie posters and propose the ''closest'' movie
poster.

The project is divided into two part:

* [a search engine](https://movies.iwoaf.com/index_complete.html) that allows you to find
  the closest posters of a particular movie (have fun with the random button)..
* [a scatter plot](https://movies.iwoaf.com/) representing 1500 randomly picked movie posters into a 2D spaces.

Don't forget that, for both of the webpages, you can click on any movie poster to get its closest posters.


**General idea:**

I thought you'd be interested in a little experiment with the ConvNets. I gain interest in
deep-learning 2 years ago and quickly wanted to exploit the power of Deep Convolutional
Neural Network.

But first, one can estimate the ''distance'' between two images by subtracting the value for each
pixels and compute some sort of euclidean distance... However it will failed most of the
time (as for example if you slightly shift an image the distance with itself can be huge
!!!). So ''close'' images can be translate as ''similar'' shapes/motifs/textures included
in both of the images. There is of course a lot of more effective solutions such as
[pHash](http://www.phash.org/) or image-maching based on Fourier transform but I'd doubt
it will give satisfying results for a relatively small movie posters database.

This is where the power of deep learning occur as it is normally able to learn
[**invariant
features**](https://www.quora.com/How-is-a-convolutional-neural-network-able-to-learn-invariant-features). The
idea is to use ConvNet as features extractor that will map images into fixed meaningful
size vectors in which we will be able to use to compute distances between each others.

So basically, you take the output of a pre-trained ConvNet for all the images and then
compute distances between each images.

I will not bother you more with the details as I wrote a [blog post](http://iwoaf.com/finding-similar-movie-posters-with-convnet-deep-learning/) about it. (it might no
longer be exactly what I did but It was written 2 years ago).

**Cherry Picking:**

All those words to give you some cherry peak example of what the algorithm consider to be
similar:

* [Truman (2015)](http://iwoaf.com/content/images/2017/04/17442_500.jpg)
* [Looking for Kitty (2004)](http://iwoaf.com/content/images/2017/04/19131_500-1.jpg)
* [The Founders (2016)](http://iwoaf.com/content/images/2017/04/36673_500.jpg)
* [The Curious Case of Benjamin Button
  (2008)](http://iwoaf.com/content/images/2017/04/21649_500.jpg)
* [Rock'n'Roll High School (1979)](http://iwoaf.com/content/images/2017/04/7135_500.jpg)

**Sofware/Library used:**

Most of the project is based on python:

* data processing: [keras](https://keras.io/), [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/5.3.x/), [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* backend: [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), flask-restful
* frontend: html, css, [d3js](https://d3js.org/), javascript is a pain guys!
* data-storage: Postgresql

By the way the data processing needs a relatively powerful computer (~32Go of RAM and a GPU
for the ConvNet part).

The datavisualizations are hosted on a VPS from [scaleway](https://scaleway.com).

**The code:**

to use it, criticize it. The code is probably not fully functional but I constantly pushed
away its promotion because of my insecurity with it.",False,0.69,0.0,0.711,0.289

After some digging it seems like pybind11 ( https://github.com/pybind/pybind11 ) is exactly what I need. However, this will be the largest project I have released and I hope will gather a healtgy user base so I want to make sure I make the right choice. 

Has anybody used pybind11? Were you happy with it? Any gotchas I should know? If my project depends on it, I would like some assurance that it won't just be abandoned in year or so.. not sure how people make these assessments, so any advice is greatly appreciated.

A vast majority of this project was put together using [Python](http://python.org), [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/), [redis-py](https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py), and [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/).

## Our Inspiration:
The typical coding competition involves algorithmic challenges on various coding platforms. The fastest and the most efficient are determined to be the best through various metrics. But we wanted to create **a platform to duel bots in a real-time head-to-head battle.**

Imagine two bot creators (ex. two students in high school) have been developing a [Pong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong) bot - each on their local machines. Now they want to put their bots up against each other - and the rest of the competitive bot community in a _classic multiplayer_ fashion.

The bot creators would need to **implement and deploy a web API around their bot, implement a multiplayer version of the game, use a data store to store game states, and design a user interface for creating/joining/watching competitions between bots**.

Our solution was bootstraping the bot creation process by implementing a stateless multiplayer server and created templates for developers who want to create bots. With our platform, **bot creators only need to write their bot logic** and _we take care of the rest_.

As a result, we made it so easy to use that this platform could also be used to teach everything from how to write your first line code to how to create a bot using AI.

## What's AI Royale?
AI Royale is a streamlined platform that makes it easy for any programmer to duel bots against other bots. We want to ensure every developer that wants to create and compete their algorithms against others can do so on our platform. 

- **Templates** - for creating live bots using [Standard Library](https://stdlib.com/)
- **Intuitive User Interface** - integrated [Standard Library's](https://stdlib.com/) IDE, [code](https://code.stdlib.com/), to make it easy for users to publish bots and go through tutorials without leaving our site or changing tabs
- **Tutorials** - [see here](https://imgur.com/a/Ny2NETV) - that teach everything from _the essentials of programming_ to _integrating AI into their bots_
- **Multiplayer Server (+Task Runner)** - for synchronizing game state and retrieving events from users' bots
- **Game Engine** - for _calculating the next game states_ from the previous game state and bots' event inputs
- **Game Lobby and Session System** - [see here](https://imgur.com/a/fhylPvK) and [here](https://imgur.com/a/oKjmmZY) - for  _matchmaking_ and _realtime spectating_ 

## How we built it:

[Architecuture Diagram](https://imgur.com/a/mjEKKOx)

- **User Interface:** HTML / CSS + Bootstrap / Native JavaScript
- **Backend:** Flask (Python Microframework) 
- **Data Store:** Redis
- **Task Runner:** Python
- **Game Engine:** Python
- **User's Bot Servers:** Standard Library API and _Sources_ functionality

We built this project using using a Flask web server for the backend; vanilla JavaScript and Boostrap on the frontend; Redis for the datastore; Python for a task runner; Python for the game engine; and [Standard Library](https://stdlib.com/) to host user's bots and edit code in the broswer.

A stateless version of Pong was created and individual games are managed by individually calculating the next state given the previous state and the bots' inputs. We also created a template on [Standard Library](https://stdlib.com/) for hosting bots to make it seemless for users to make live bots for multiplayer.






## EDIT - I got a comment asking for a beginner explaination so I'll add it to the original post:

Note: I am using pong as an example, since it is the only game we implemented. Whenever I mention **_game state_** I'm simply refering to (in the case of pong) the location of the paddles, the location of the ball, the velocity of the ball, and the score.

_The following headers are directly related to the names given on the diagram._

## Client (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):
Pretty simple - we used vanilla JS, and bootstrap. Since it was a hackathon I took the simplest approach to keeping the client in sync with the game state. Simply polling (a.k.a. AJAX-requesting over and over again) the current game state from the backend and updating the Pong rendering if it changed.

## Backend (Python and Flask):
More accurately, this is the _web_ backend. Here I used Python (see resource 1) and Flask (see resource 2 & 3) to interface with the client. The purpose of the backend was to simply serve the frontend files, get the user's bot API URLs, and serve the state to the frontend for rendering. Here, authentication is done by setting a user's cookie to their username and check it on every request since it didn't need to be a secure application at the hackathon (DON'T DO THIS, check resource 4).

## Data Storage (Redis with [redis-py](https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py)):
Redis stores data by associating a value to a key. My keys were the game ids and the values were Python dictionaries used to store game state turned into a JSON string (this is not good practice but it worked for the hackathon). Redis is used for storing game state and usernames. The game state includes (in the case of Pong) the location of paddles, the location and velocity of the ball, and the bot urls. I chose Redis because I would be accessing the data store as fast as the bots responded (and it was easy to set up and use).

## Task Runner (Python):
This was simply another Python program with a main while loop that would be analogous to the main game loop that most game engines use. Every loop, the script would check for active games (game states stored in Redis with the **start** flag equal to true). It would extract the bot urls from the game state and request the bot's next move from the bot APIs created by the user.

## Game Engine (Python):
This is a module I wrote to calculate what the next frame of the game should be, given the bot's actions and the previous game state. This is what detected collisions, updates stores, calculates the physics of the ball movement, moves the paddles, etc. etc. So simply, you input the current game state and the players' (the bots) inputs, and it gives you back the next game state.

## Bot Server (JavaScript on [Standard Library](https://stdlib.com/)):
Here I harnessed the power of [Standard Library](https://stdlib.com/) to allow users to simply write stateless bot logic and deploy their bots as a web API (see resource 7) with the click of a button.

**Description:** Managing of all software projects have some common obstacles, how to manage dependencies,  package and deploy. And in this process, taking care of large amount of dependencies of the software you’re working on is often complicated. Among other things, taking care of dependencies means keeping them up to date, tracking bug fixes and breaking changes of new versions. This is very time consuming and painful.

I've *NEVER* had any use for a 2D array of data. ~~Half the time the outputs for a lot of contour interpolation algorithms are vectors, not 2D.~~ \[See Edit 3\]. I understand it's application in tensor-like notation, but it's *so* much more difficult to work with.

Rant over, what's a simple way to take data that's in (x, y, z) points and turn it into 2D arrays? Note I'm not talking about non-organized-grid data. I'm talking about data that I literally created through `scipy.interpolate.griddata` , which requires organized grid input and outputs a vector z. I've seen [this StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/38751293/7564988) answer (where I'd use Method 3), but it just seems ridiculous that I'd have to do it this way.

&#x200B;

Edit: Rant expansion:Why does `griddata` , the only interpolation method for elevation-like data, require that the mesh points be in a rectangular form? Why can't I just assign arbitrary points?I work in computational fluids where we have very high gradients along walls that require a very high fidelity to resolve correctly. Since I have to use a rectangular grid, if I want that high fidelity at the wall of a non-rectangular shape, I have to apply the high fidelity mesh to the entire flow field when I only need it in a very small area. For my most recent project I'm having to evaluate 4,000,000 points when my actual computational model only has to use around \~50,000 to resolve the same area (because it can vary the distribution of points randomly).

Edit 2: Note that when I'm talking about computational fluids stuff, I'm referring to 2D planar boundary conditions, not the actual 3D mesh itself.

It was on 4th September 2017 when I landed a job through my college campus. Things started changing and I ironically realized the importance of programming after getting a job. The job was tempting, it had everything to offer; satisfying salary and a very good company brand name.

I picked Python on 5th September and started programming. I built more than 15 projects using Python as the core programming language. The projects revolved around domains of Machine learning, Data Science, Image processing, Web Development and Scraping. I started loving Github more and more and those green blocks fueled me to contribute day in and out.

It felt really amazing that how can a language be so simple yet so explicit and appealing. I stick with the same pattern of utilizing Python and learning from basics like list, tuples to more advanced like generators, descriptors, iterators, context managers etc. This happened from a period of 4th September - 31st July 2018

&#x200B;

**#InTime (Now):**

After July I was forced to start my job after completing my graduate in CS. I was really excited to enter the corporate culture and learn new things. Moreover my job revolved around the domains of Big Data and Analytics. So it did have bits and bytes of Python involved; but I was fucked up. I realized I din't have the freedom to program regularly as I used to do for over 15 hours during my post placement days. I started feeling bored, frustrated and very angry with my job.

It was 5th October 2018 when I was honored to be a speaker at PyCon India 2018 (The annual Python Conference of India). Then came PyBITS 2018, (The annual Python conference of BITS Pilani College) where I was invited again to speak.

And now very recently I was honored to represent India as a speaker at PyCon Balkan 2018 (The annual Python Conference of Balkan Nations).

So to summon up, I have tags of regional, national and an international speaker upon me within a span of 3 months. And here I am back to my lifeless job and wondering what to do next.

&#x200B;

**#Future (After):**

Python has given me everything until today - Programming ability, speaking ability and the passion, love to code and program, contribute and eventually educate the people in whatever tiny ways we can. This job sucks in all aspects hence I decide to embark on a new journey with Python as my lone friend. I have decided to pursue my masters in CS from fall 2019 which will help me focus on job interviews in future. Its gonna be tough but I know with Python as my companion and the amazing community that it possesses, nothing is impossible.

Meteor M2 weather satellite sends down images that are thin in width.  A gradual horizontal scale is applied to make the correction to the image.  I'd like to do this correction in python.  I used a tool Smooth Meteor (free) to scale an example grid image to visualize what is going on.

I guess both options are viable, it just changes how you handle your data afterwards that changes.

On the other hand, you might want to manipulate this list without changing the actual data.

It is python good for simple games?,Python,2,9z2gy5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/9z2gy5/it_is_python_good_for_simple_games/,14,2018-11-21 06:35:20,"Hello I don't wanna call me Newbie, but I had some experience with some languages and really don't know on which level I am (but probably still low :D). I want to ask: Is python good for making simple game like old browser games with fresh style like SFGame (which is made in flash) with only basics systems like wearing items (equipment), fight (pvp), quests (like in sfgame). I give up like 2 times, once in JS when it came to use AJAX that makes my code so weird and second attempt was in Pyhton but I failed at start using tkinter (anyway I have learned to much, graphic support was so bad).

    fruits = {
        'banana': ('yellow', 'tasty', 9), 
        'apple': ('red', 'bad', 1), 
    }

But I dislike the way I access the values, using a numerical index doesn't tell me anything about the data I'm retrieving:

    what_is_this = fruits['banana'][0]

The other way to do this would using dicts inside dicts:

    fruits = {
        banana': {'color': 'yellow', 'taste':'tasty', 'stock':9}, 
        'apple': {'color': 'red', 'taste':'bad', 'stock':1}, 
    } 
    color = fruits['banana']['color']

'But then it becomes very annoying to write the constants, since I'll have to repeat the keys multiple times.

So I came up with an idea to solve the problem:

    # Proposed solution
    fruits = | 
        'banana': ('yellow', 'tasty', 9), 
        'apple': ('red', 'bad', 1), 
    | 
    color = fruits['banana']['color']

However, I don't know if it's possible to assign an arbitrary expression to an arbitrary symbol like that in python, so I compromised and implemented it using a class and the \_\_getitem\_\_() method, which lead to the following syntax:

    fruits = Table(
    ['fruit', 'color', 'taste', 'stock'],
    [
        ('banana', 'yellow', 'tasty', 9),
        ('apple', 'red', 'bad', 1),
    ]) 
    assert fruits['banana']['color'] == 'yellow' 
    assert fruits['banana']['stock'] == 9 
    print('OK')

I put the (very simple) implementation on a gist:

And believe me, I had a whole variety of feelings.

First of all, it all started as ""Wow, it solves so many existing problems! Let's test it!"". Then, we had a pleasant experience of using it in one of our projects. 

Next, we have moved all out projects to it. And that's when stuff began to fall apart. There are probably three main problems we have faced, that completely broke our experience:

1. Upgrade all dependencies by default. Whenever you install any new package all other packages will be upgraded. Wait, is not `lock` file suppose to handle this? I don't know. But, probably any new package installation on a big project will break everything. Sometimes I even thought that it is a good thing: I have to constantly upgrade your project so it won't become a legacy. But, no. It does not work this way.

2. Bugs. Bugs! A lot of them. Dependencies in `python` are not easy. That's true. But, I have suffered so many bugs! Resolution bugs, installation bugs, regressions, shell bugs, all kinds of bugs. I know possibly all workaround for them: I know when to use `sed`, when to start from scratch, when to increase resolution rounds, etc, etc. Here's the full list of issues submitted just by me: https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/issues?q=is%3Aissue+author%3Asobolevn

3. Release cycle. Sometimes you can wait for a bug fix for several weeks, sometimes you can have three releases in a single day. And a new release will most likely to break something new.

So, we have moved all our projects to `poetry`. And it works like a charm!
I had a lot of open-source projects that used `poetry` for almost 4~5 months now. And I had experienced just several bugs.

New release of our `django` template is available. Now with `poetry`.
It also features new `pytest` plugins for TDD and better test quality control.
It also features `wemake-python-styleguide` which is the strictest and the most opinionated `python` linter ever.
And a massive documentation upgrade.

I was frustrated with how difficult I found making animations in matplotlib so I wrote something to make it easy and called it [celluloid](https://github.com/jwkvam/celluloid). I found the idea in plotnine and simply took out the plotnine specific code and generalized it some more (adding support for subplots).

The goal is that your visualization code shouldn't need to modified at all or as little as possible. With celluloid you take ""photos"" of your visualization to create each frame. Once all the frames have been captured you can create an animation with one call. See the [readme](https://github.com/jwkvam/celluloid) for more details.

I think the main audience for this is people who read the [matplotlib animation tutorial](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2012/08/18/matplotlib-animation-tutorial/) and thought it was still too complex.

I  was told by my friend to say this can ""snapchatify"" your reddit and twitter accounts, and that seems to make sense to most of the less tech savvy people I've talked with. For the rest of you, this software lets  you clear out the old posts on reddit and twitter easily, saving the  ones you want, running it automatically on a schedule, and has a nice GUI to help you with this process.

The  number one concern I got with the previous versions was people saying they are annoyed by these programs when they go back to an old reddit thread and a comment they need has been deleted by the owner. I listened and think I have addressed that with the new whitelist feature:

[https://imgur.com/eqr2lWr](https://imgur.com/eqr2lWr)

This feature allows you to save the posts you think are important and useful, they will be protected no matter what other options you select.  They are also saved between sessions so if you close the program and reopen it the posts will still be whitelisted.

I  just want to say this is still a pre-release project, I have done my best to test this but I don't have a QA team under my belt, it's just me, so please \*use at your own risk\*!

The simplest thing to do would be to embed an xterm inside my app and run the simple terminal `readline()` program inside it. But then how do I communicate the commands inside the terminal to the surrounding graphical app? Sockets? Seems a little hokey. But it's the only thing I've thought of.

The most notable improvement being that it now supports [Trio](https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) ASGI frameworks. You can enable Trio via the worker class, `hypercorn --worker-class trio [module]:[app]`, I've blogged about this [here](https://medium.com/@pgjones/hypercorn-is-now-a-trio-asgi-server-2e198898c08f) if you want to learn more. This version also implements the new ASGI lifespan protocol allowing frameworks to startup and shutdown cleanly.

To illustrate what the lifespan protocol can be used for, consider this simple ASGI framework,
```python
class App:

    def __init__(self, scope):
        pass

    async def __call__(self, receive, send):
        while True:
            event = await receive()
            if event['type'] == 'lifespan.startup':
                self.connection_pool = await create_pool()
                await send({'type': 'lifespan.startup.complete'})
            elif event['type'] == 'lifespan.shutdown':
                await self.connection_pool.close()
                await send({'type': 'lifespan.shutdown.complete'})
```
if it still isn't clear, consider how you would otherwise create and close the pool asynchronously before and after serving requests.

## What is ASGI

From the [docs](https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),

> ASGI, Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface, is a spiritual successor to WSGI, intended to provide a  standard interface between async-capable Python web servers, frameworks, and applications.

ASGI is the emerging standard for writing asynchronous servers and frameworks. It originates from the Django-Channels community were it is mostly used. Microframeworks such as [Quart](https://gitlab.com/pgjones/quart), and [Starlette](https://github.com/encode/starlette) are ASGI based and I'm hopeful Sanic will [follow suit](https://community.sanicframework.org/t/considering-asgi-support/70/8_. Servers alongside Hypercorn include [Daphne](https://github.com/django/daphne), and [Uvicorn](https://github.com/encode/uvicorn).

## What is Trio

From the [docs](https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),

> Trio: async programming for humans and snake people

I think Trio builds on the `async, await` keywords to produce an API which is much cleaner and clearer than any of Python's other concurrency libraries.

## What is HTTP/2

From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2)

> HTTP/2 (originally named HTTP/2.0) is a major revision of the HTTP network protocol used by the World Wide Web. 

Hypercorn will serve HTTP/2 to any client that makes a h2 request, this has advantages as HTTP/2 should result in a faster experience for the client.",False,0.4404,0.0,0.838,0.162

My search for a secondary language: most other languages are so un-Pythonic! (intermediate-Pythoneer crisis),Python,2,9xee5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/9xee5m/my_search_for_a_secondary_language_most_other/,8,2018-11-15 14:29:42,"I first started learning Python about two and a half years ago. I fell in love with the language and programmed extensively in Python for the next two years. I was a beginner programmer before then (only knowing basic level Java) and the power and ease of Python for automating my desktop, web scraping and network programming fascinated me and I then went on to learn NumPy, scikit-learn and matplotlib, fascinated by how accessible crude ML was to a beginner like me. I then learnt Django, Flask and SQLAlchemy. I built a website for my friend and did all the server provisioning and deployment by myself. I built numerous toy personal web apps for my personal use on free hosting services. I also built Discord bots and used APIs of Dropbox, Facebook and PRAW for Reddit to do things which deeply thrilled me. I learnt Python concepts like decorators and asyncio and used numerous inbuilt and third-party libraries and frameworks.

Early on itself when I looked at my code and especially when I looked at other people's code I realized that I wrote unmaintainable and unorganized code. I also never really got OOP and did not even use functions fully and effectively to write modular code.

However over the past few months as a result of gaining some experience at writing code and the desire to be more organized and efficient I started focusing more on these aspects than before and also started running out of new things that completely blew my mind about what could be done with a small Python script. I have a much better grasp over OOP now, however I feel that trying to think in terms of OOP hinders my productivity at writing the actual logic of the program even if the code is less messy. It will probably get better as I write more OOP code. As I deployed a couple more web apps and REST server back-end for some Android apps I also became more conscious of the resource which Python consumes on my VPS nodes. I had to build a websocket based web app which would hold many websocket connections simultaneously and felt that I could squeeze so much better performance with a statically typed compiled language.

As a result I had a week where I learnt the basics of C++, Go and a little bit of Rust to use for my websocket server. I chose Go finally and I moderately enjoyed writing my server. Looking at all the benchmarks of all these languages combined with a certain cleanliness and elegance of a compiled statically typed language like C made me consider learning a secondary language which was much more performant as well as easier to deploy (just uploading the compiled binary rather than worrying about virtualenvs and the overhead of interpreter and GIL) than Python. It just feels like I would be a more complete programmer if I had good command over a non-interpreted more traditional general programming language.

But the problem I have come up against in my search for a second language is that all of them seem to be so un-Pythonic! The most wholesome language after Python that I could find was C. It meshes so well with the Unix philosophy and open source world and I love its simplicity and elegance. But the use of macros, the jungle of conditional includes, the lack of a standard library for advanced data structures and algorithms, and the general low-levelness when other more modern and higher level languages can provide a relatively good enough performance makes me hesitant of jumping into the world of serious C programming.

Given its closeness to C I find C++ likeable and it certainly packs a lot more features than C. But it suffers from the same problems of conditional includes, large compilation time and other un-Pythonic things such as too many ways to do a thing and too many features. I have no clue what's the idiomatic way to write modern C++ code if there is any.

Java's biggest weakness for me is JVM which nullifies the allure of a compiled binary which can easily be run in another machine without setting up the environment. JVM also produces some runtime overhead and the GC in Java is just as bad for memory footprint. Also, I doubt if Java's idea of OOP is really how OOP should be done.

I also looked at two modern languages Go and Rust. Go is such an easy language to pick up and has a very neat design. But its compact feature set probably affects expressiveness and more importantly it's not quite as performant and memory-friendly as some other languages.

The final language among those I explored is Rust. It's unique feature of ownership which causes Rust to provide not just memory management but also provide safety against things like race conditions arising in concurrent programming is certainly quite handy. Though it comes at the price of putting in more thought to low-level constructs instead of business logic. But unlike C and C++ it's a much cleaner language and has lesser compile time and easier package management. Though given how new it is there is a shortage of mature frameworks and require a lot of updating and dependency management.

Another problem that I found was the community around these languages. I was initiated under the Unix philosophy of avoiding monolithic code and writing smaller modular programs which do just one thing and do it well. But browsing the subreddits and other places of languages such as Java I saw commonly held views such as microservices are only good for large enterprises and that monolithic codebase should be preferred at smaller organizations. These languages also seem to encourage huge GUI-based IDEs which I never felt was necessary in my Python programming.

I would love to hear the more experienced and able CS engineers here to give their opinion on this.

**TL;DR: I'm an intermediate level Python programmer. I'm wondering what my next step should be to grow as a CS engineer (I'm also a third year CS major undergrad). I'm also looking to add a high performant compiled language to my skillset and was wondering what the best language would be, and what should my approach be in my journey in that language.**",False,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

I wrote a prototype of our application in C#, using IronPython, and that's where this confusion comes in. IronPython makes it **so straighforward.** I have a pure C# object that gets passed in a single line of code and all functions and variables are converted automatically.

[Python's documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/extending/embedding.html) lays out some groundwork for the process of embedding and extending, but it seems we would have to implement a lot of functionality on our own, and nobody wants to reinvent the wheel.
[Pybind 11's documentation](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advanced/embedding.html) says it can extend AND embed, but it certainly doesn't seem to be what pybind is meant for. It's very difficult to find documentation for it and it seems a LOT has to be done manually. After a lot of work we've been able to get something to work. But the process has been very tedious, and very ugly. It seems we have to implement the API as a python module?? A ""static class"" that has no access to the context of the application at large. And the entire thing has to be manually added using macros. Most answers we find online start with something like ""this isn't actually what pybind is meant for, but..."" and there are many downsides for each implementation.

Sympy: trying to derive dynamic model for satellite,Python,2,9wwvuu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/9wwvuu/sympy_trying_to_derive_dynamic_model_for_satellite/,0,2018-11-13 23:48:45,"Hello, I am trying to make a satellite dynamic model. The model has a center body with all 6 degree of freedoms, and 2 solar panels on each side with 3 rotational degree of freedom ([https://imgur.com/iwz11gG](https://imgur.com/iwz11gG)). The rotational degree of freedom can be controlled by torques at the joint. . Ive made the system using unity but it isn't conserving angular momentumThis is the code I have as of now but it keeps giving me error ""Velocity of point PR1\_COM has not been defined in ReferenceFrame W"".

Logic:

* User is selected by IP address.
* Users are only able to skip video if finish currently video, reload page wont work. Server check if video  watched video til the end.
* Video starts muted to enable auto-play, audio start if user interact with the page.
* No able to select video iframe. (pause/skip video)

Basically, what it does is searches online for remote jobs available and posts them automatically. I scrape the site for the title of the job and the company looking to hire, it then replaces text in a premade svg template i have, i use Inkscape to convert the new svg to a jpg, and then I used the instagramAPI python library to upload it. The script is set to run once every 20 minutes or so. The instagram account is @remote.jobs.daily.

New package that makes Pandas easier to write/read -- requesting feedback and code review,Python,25,9wew6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/9wew6z/new_package_that_makes_pandas_easier_to_writeread/,20,2018-11-12 10:23:19,"Hi /r/python! I'm a data scientist who's fed up with the verbosity of Pandas code, when compared to R+dplyr and the Spark DataFrame API. So wrote I the [pandas-anaphora](https://github.com/gwerbin/pandas-anaphora) package to try and make my life easier.

The idea is not only save keystrokes but also to make Pandas code more concise and readable. It is intended to make the transition between ""logic"" and ""code"" as seamless and fluent as possible, so you can spend more time analyzing your data.

It would be great to get API/UX feedback from others who use Pandas regularly, and code/tests feedback from experienced Python devs. Tips and feedback on documentation (which is very much a ""first draft"" right now) would be appreciated as well.

To save you a click through to Github, here's an example comparing plain Pandas with Anaphora:

The regular Pandas way:

    b_above_4 = data['b'] > 4
    data.loc[b_above_4, 'x'] = data.loc[b_above_4, 'a']

    a_is_3 = data['a']
    data.loc[a_is_3, 'a'] = 300

    data.loc['this', 'b'] = -data.loc['this', 'b']

The Anaphora way:

    data = data \
        .with_column('x', Col('a'), Col('b') > 4) \
        .with_column('a', 300, loc=Col() == 3) \

Qt without coding Qt... PySimpleGUIQt hits Alpha status,Python,5,9whl8m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/9whl8m/qt_without_coding_qt_pysimpleguiqt_hits_alpha/,2,2018-11-12 15:07:43,"Edited the post to add a new image and Reddit deleted the entire post.... so here's a summary...

PySimpleGUI has been ported to Qt.  You can get it by pip installing:

    pip install PySimpleGUIQt

 PySimpleGUIQt is backwards compatible with PySimpleGUI.  That means if you have code you wrote that is currently running on PySimpleGUI, you only need to change your import from PySimpleGUI to PySimpleGUIQt and you'll be up and running on Qt.  You will need to install Qt of course.

&#x200B;

PySimpleGUIQt requires either PySide2 or PyQt5.  The module will attempt PySide2 first and if not found will fall back to PyQt5.

&#x200B;

NOTE - This Qt port is at the ALPHA stage.  Some features are not fully implemented.  If your project cannot stand instability, then it's suggested that you stick with the original PySimpleGUI for now.

I have been working on a python library for interfacing with CoNLL files in python, that I'd appreciate you taking a look at!

For those that aren't familiar, CoNLL is a format for linguistic sentence annotation. One of the most popular multilingual treebanks, Universal Dependencies uses this format to annotate sentence structure. I wanted to provide a pure and simple python experience for working with CoNLL-U, that I hadn't been able to find while working with the project.

As python is heavily used in computational linguistics, I figure this is an appropriate forum. Any feedback on the work is appreciated! If this is not the right forum or way to promote personal work here, please let me know.

I am a second year mechanical engineering student and this year I have a course numerical methods. In this class we are learning about python and how can we use it for solving engineering problems. A part (30%) of the final grade is also a project that we have to do it on our own and can be anything we want. There are some rules though. My program should include:

* symbol solving (Sympy)
* systems of linear equations
* interpolation or approximation
* finding zeroes of polynoms
* integrals or derivatives
* solving of differential equations
* use of matplotlib

Besides these that are a must, use of a few others are encouraged like: use of Raspberry Pi or Arduino, Pandas, Flask, Django, TensorFlow,...

The problem is that I have never before coded in my life and all this is completely new to me. The second problem is that we were told we have to start working on our project before the end of class, preferebly we should start now (4 weeks into the class that lasts for 14 weeks) and that we will upgrade our project every week when we learn something new. Until now we have learned: basics of Python, Sympy, Matplotlib, Numpy and how to work with files. So we haven't even started with most of the things that we should include in our project.

My question is what are some projects I can work on? I have a problem of finding something that will include everything we need.

Writing Python prototype code that's easier to convert to C++,Python,35,9vsgkz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/9vsgkz/writing_python_prototype_code_thats_easier_to/,36,2018-11-10 02:17:15,"I work in an academic lab and me and my co-workers are writing a program that performs scientific simulations.

The data structure manipulated by the program is essentially a bunch of arrays which are processed using genetic algorithms and/or Monte Carlo simulations. The computationally intensive part will be eventually implemented by a \*real\* programmer in C++ and OpenCL, while we're mostly focused on getting the science right and write all the data pre-processing.

The pre-processing basically consists in loading molecules using a module that is a C++ library (OpenBabel) wrapped in Python to build graphs, assign parameters, and store properties in 1D arrays. This data will be then used by the C++/OpenCL code to be written, which will perform the calculations. So far we've written about 4k lines of Python (including comments and docstrings), and I'm expecting the total will be less than 10k.

Does anyone has advice to share on what's the best way to write this code in a way that will simplify the process of translating everything in C++, once the programmer will be hired?

We are all fairly fluent in Python and OOP, but we're actively making an effort to avoid stuff like generators (expanding everything into explicit for-loops) and other *pythonic* patterns that we know do not exist in C++ and/or will require too much explanation if the programmer is not familiar with Python.

For the same reason, we're avoiding loading external modules and libraries, including Numpy, and use standard lists as arrays (poor performance in Python, but more easy to explain and convert).

One of the co-workers told me that one major thing to avoid is to design functions that return tuples/more than one variable, and prefer separate 1D arrays over multi-dimensional ones.

 

Any comment is more than welcome (including ""you're wasting your time"").

TL;DR: Advice on writing Python code that can be easily translated to C++.

### Here's a little glimpse of my bot (PS: it is still under active development)

### How to use the bot?
To use the bot, type:

``!dict word``

The first part, i.e. ""!dict"" **is not** case sensitive.

The bot will then give you the Oxford Dictionary (or Urban Dictionary; if the word does not exist in the Oxford Dictionary) definition of the word as a comment reply.

---

### How does the bot work?

The bot first extracts the word from the comment and then fetches word definitions, part of speech, example and source from the Oxford Dictionary API.

If the word does not exist in the Oxford Dictionary, the Oxford API then returns a 404 response upon which the bot then tries to fetch results form the Urban Dictionary API.

The bot uses the Pushshift API to fetch comments, PRAW module to reply to comments and Heroku as a server.

The entire bot is written in Python 3.6

Kalman Filter Trajectory Tracking,Python,7,9vhewa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/9vhewa/kalman_filter_trajectory_tracking/,15,2018-11-08 23:29:54,"I have an accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer. I want to track location trajectories.

Right now I have logged lots of acceleration data using just the accelerometer sensor. It tracks (cartesian coordinates) X, Y, and Z accelerations in units of g-force (m/s2). I did a bunch of offset and noise removal. The device has some errors and requires calibration to get the signals to report precisely zero forces when stationary. Also, noise needed to be removed below a certain threshold in an attempt to minimize as much error propagation as possible. Finally, I integrated the data once to produce velocity (m/s) and validated that it is correct. Keep in mind, integration introduces some error, but in the case of velocity, it is somewhat negligible. Then, I integrated a second time to produce the position (m).

Now, with an accelerometer alone, the location trajectories are completely misrepresentative because the double integration just blows up the signals so much that the trajectory plot is entirely misrepresentative of the actual movement of the device (sensor). No amount of noise removal or offset correction will allow for the trajectories produced to show accurately. However, with projections on each 3D plane, it can be seen that for small tests (under 1 minute in length), the distance tracked is somewhat accurate, but there is an immense drift in other planes. So, when the device was only moved on the XY plane in one direction, the trajectory plot will actually report that the device has moved in the Z direction, the YZ plane, etc.

After some google research, I am realizing that attempting to track location trajectories is not feasible with the method I have attempted. The double integration just introduces so much error that it is pointless, UNLESS, a Kalman filter or combination of data is utilized (data fusion).

What I want to do now, is perform tests with my device and measure data using the Accelerometer, Gyroscope, and Magnetometer simultaneously. These are all 3-axis sensors and will produce 3 columns of data corresponding to X, Y, and Z in their respective measurements. The gyroscope produces angular acceleration, and the magnetometer acts as a compass with 3 measurements as well.

With these 3 sources of data (9 metrics in groups of 3 total), I have determined it is possible to plug these all into an algorithm utilizing Kalman Filters to calculate roll, yaw, and pitch (these are 3 Euler Angles, which are critical for producing accurate location trajectory). Apparently, doing this will yield the accurate/precise trajectories that I am seeking. But I have no idea how to go about it, or what resources to use. I know scipy has a Kalman filter library, and that there is some sparse documentation on the topic in Matlab and also with IMU sensors in random online projects, but otherwise I am a bit lost.

TLDR; I need help learning Kalman filters and how to use them to fuse data and create Euler Angles of Roll, Yaw, and Pitch to track trajectories. My data sources are 3-axis sensors: accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer

You can create the exact same looking and functioning Qt windows than if you hand coded it.  There is no difference in the overall look and feel between a PySimpleGUI Qt Window and a hand-coded and Qt Designer made window.... at least for windows that are not crazy complex.

If you've wanted to move your GUI over to Qt but don't have the time nor perhaps ability to learn Qt, this could be one good path for you.  And if you already have running PySimpleGUI code, then moving over to Qt is a trivial process.  You'll get a fantastic visual makeover going from tkinter to Qt at the expense of changing your import to PySimpleGUIQt.

You can install it by executing:

    pip install pysimpleguiqt

Be sure and install PySide2 as well

    pip install pyside2

This project is under rapid development, so expect there to be frequent updates.  And, with it being Pre-Alpha, expect it to be not fully feature complete with a few bugs too.  It's far enough along to play with and generate simple GUIs.

This window would require quite a bit of code if you coded directly using Qt5.  It's under 50 lines using PySimpleGUIQt.

Here's the code for this window.  It represented over 30 Qt widgets.  ***It only takes a single line of code to add a widget to your window.***  This is why PySimpleGUI programs are so compact, succinct, and easy to read.  If you want text on your window, you use a Text element.  No confusing terminology to learn like QLabel instead of Text.

We (work) have produced our own Python install packages for years (almost decades) that included everything all of our software needed. Our stuff (scientific software) is used on just about every platform. Having our own package also kept the versions of everything known which led to few surprises. Now we are going to go to, probably, something like Anaconda and git and etc. I guess we need some surprises in our life.

&#x200B;

I have a MacBook running High Sierra. Installed the full Anaconda, created a 2.7 and a 3.7 environment, activated one of them and fired up a program that uses Tkinter for the GUI. It looks like it is using Apple's version of Tcl/Tk/Tkinter which is crap. Buttons don't work, it looks bad, etc. What do I do to get ""some other"" version of Tkinter or tell the environment to use the Tcl/Tk in Anaconda (it's 8.6.3, which, I think, is what our package has)? With our package we have XQuartz installed on Macs and it starts when you start the program and then it uses our package's version of Tcl/Tk/Tkinter.

I work on **Django, DRF** project. We have **unittests** written using **pytest** and some **pytest** plugins. Now it's time to write integration tests for our REST API and the problem is that I can't find any examples in the web. I have some scenarios that should be tested.

Do you use the black-default line length of 88 or do you override it to e.g. 79 (pep8 standard)?

&#x200B;

I personally have now adjusted my linters to use line length 88 and using black with all its defaults. However, I am not completely sure whether I want it this way, or if I would prefer to keep linters at their defaults (79) and tell black to use that. I can tell that my scripts become a little shorter, at the expense of vertical screen real estate (I like to keep three editor tabs opened, side by side). If you are using black, what are your settings like, and why?

&#x200B;

EDIT: I went back to using yapf and line length 79 for now. Reasons being yapf can format on paste, black replaces single quotes with double quotes (this can be turned off, I know), a strange method args formatting choice in black ...and I'm still not convinced the few extra line length chars makes sense to me right now, as so many other things expect 79 and not 88.

You can download the Qt version [here](https://github.com/MikeTheWatchGuy/PySimpleGUI/tree/master/QtVersionExperimental).

You'll need to install PySide2, which is a pip install now.

>pip install pyside2

&#x200B;

Then copy and paste the files from GitHub and run.  There are 3 files test files and the source file for PySimpleGUI\_Qt.  

If you want to run your old code tkinter code on Qt, you'll need to change the size parameters. All sizes are now pixel units.  That means you'll need to change your source, perhaps.   It's an easy ""port"".

&#x200B;

Please understand this is not a production level release, it's more like a pre-Alpha, or engineering release.  It's still fun to play around with Qt, even if limited.   You can 'update' elements, but advanced features like change\_submits are not yet complete.  The port only started yesterday.

There are more widgets being added that are Qt specific, like the Dial widget.   Here's the code required to make the little  window with the new Dial widget:

There are two main reasons I'm doing this. First, I'm a teacher at heart and love to share my love of programming with others. Second, creating tutorials / learn to 
program series is time consuming and as much as I would love to create them, I just don't have the time. Additionally, creating tutorials often misses
an important piece of programming education: the design process. Doing a live stream will (hopefully) show the entire design process and also provide a way
for potential coders to ask questions.

This is a bit of an experiment for me to see if it is possible to create something useful with a smaller amount of time invested. After the live stream,
I plan to write up a postmortem referencing sections of the video and have the code + all of the commit history preserved for others to use.

#### How can I prepare if I want to code along?

I will be implementing all of the code in Python 3.6 since Lambda AWS doesn't yet support 3.7. I suspect that the majority of the stream will be watching
me talk through the design decisions related to parsing and calculating results. I will be hosting the code on a public github repo so that people can clone
and follow along with the code as it is on my end. Who knows, maybe I'll even be able to get someone to perform a PR and merge their code in.

The Slack Integration will require that you have admin privileges on a slack workspace and that you have an AWS account. 

You can create a slack workspace free here: https://slack.com/

The AWS Lambda implementation will utilize AWS API Gateways and AWS CloudWatch. Everything we do will fall into the free tier and shouldn't cost you
anything (though I do think you need a credit card to sign up). You can create an AWS account here: https://aws.amazon.com/

This is an example of something you can do in modern C++ that would have been almost impossible (or very difficult) to do in old C++:

I have implemented a heterogenous vector (much like Python lists) using std::vector underneath. It is not the common vector of void pointers approach, or one of its many variations (they really defeats the purpose).

On top of that I have implemented a Pandas-like data frame. You could do almost everything you could do with Pandas within the C++ syntax and type checking framework. You can add/delete any column type, slice, run summarization functors, transpose, etc. like Pandas. But I also added something that Pandas doesn’t have; views. You can slice the data frame and instead of getting another data frame you can opt to get a view. A view is a data frame that is a reference to a slice of the original data frame. So if you change the data in the view the corresponding data in the original data frame will also be changed.
