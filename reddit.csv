My mother killed herself with a gun after a long battle with mental illness. I am now advocating for a “no guns” self-registry in Louisiana where firearms are a way of life. AMA,politics,84,a41y9y,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/a41y9y/my_mother_killed_herself_with_a_gun_after_a_long/,31,2018-12-07 12:20:13,"My name is Katrina Brees and this year my mother committed suicide with a gun following a long battle with mental illness. She is the sixth person in my family to commit suicide and I am worried for my own future and that of my loved ones. So, I am advocating for the creation of a “no guns” self-registry. This would allow people, who think they might be a danger to themselves or others, to put their names on a list that would prohibit gun dealers from selling them firearms. Washington recently passed a similar registry, but the battle ahead will be fierce in Louisiana where gun rights are second-to-none.
 
[My story](https://www.nola.com/expo/news/erry-2018/09/39f7db7652102/after-mothers-suicide-katrina.html) was first reported in [NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune](https://www.nola.com/) as part of a [series](https://www.nola.com/health/index.ssf/page/a_fragile_state.html) investigating how Louisiana’s fragmented and severely underfunded mental health network is burdening families from every walk of life. I know if my mother had a second chance, she would have gladly put her name on such a list. Ask me anything.
 
Joining me is Richard Webster, the journalist who reported my story. Ask him anything, too! We’ll both be responding from u/NOLAnews
