"Is the soap opera effect ACTUALLY bad, or are we just conditioned to see high-speed cameras as ""low quality"" and 24 fps as ""film quality?""",movies,34,a40a9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/a40a9w/is_the_soap_opera_effect_actually_bad_or_are_we/,80,2018-12-07 09:19:03,"We do not see the world at 24 fps, we see it continuously.

I understand the argument that you are not seeing what the director wants you to see, and I am sympathetic to it. But isn't the solution for directors to assume that their video will be seen at high framerates, and to film accordingly? AFAIK there is no good artistic reason to show movies at 24 fps except that ""everyone does it,"" because physical film is going the way of the vinyl record.

I love the score. It sets the tone perfectly. Dark, yet hopeful. I generally bristle at operatic tones but it fits the feel of the film perfectly. 

The use of color really puts the viewer in the feel of the movie. Everything is so bleak  and grey. The only brightly colored shots are in the setting the main character, Theo, feels comfortable and calm in, meanwhile, in the rest of the world, where danger lurks behind every corner, all you see are drab sets and muted color. 

The casting, my god the casting, is unreal. From Clive Owen, to Michael Caine, there are so many great actors. Clive Owen’s understated acting style fits perfect for the character he plays, a down and out bureaucrat, thrust into a world he doesn’t necessarily want to be a part of. 

The set design is incredible. Cuarón’s almost dogmatic approach to “show, don’t tell” thrusts you into the dystopian world from the start. From billboards, to caged refugees, the viewer gains an understanding the director wants to portray. You feel engulfed in the world the film is set in, arguably better than any similarly plotted film has done before. 

Cuarón’s shots are unparalleled in this film. From the much discussed tracking shot, which takes place during a battle no less, to use of perspective and appropriate use of “shaky-cam” this film puts the viewer directly in the action. You feel as if you are the main character. Every reveal, reaction, discovery, etc. is shot beautifully so you can feel every emotion and realization Theo does.

One bit I really remember is that the chap's friend (who the main guy is seeking revenge for) was shot and then fed to some alligators that the bad guys kept under the pier type thing leading to the water. I'm not sure but I think the girl could be the daughter of the guy fed to the alligators.

Although there was some degree of attempted manipulation the communities view stood out and you could easily tell whether a film was worth giving a go.

Unfortunately now the level of corporate manipulation on film ratings and reviews being upvoted or downvoted out of existence on the site have destroyed the entire system. Films that should by all means be at 5/10 are sitting at 7-9/10 supposedly on a comparable level to films such as The Shawshank Redemption and Schindlers List. On top of that critical reviews by genuine users get downvoted deliberately so they are not seen without digging for them.

I don't know whether IMBD are in on the act themselves but if they are not something needs to be done about it. It has even led to me leaving unfair reviews just to try and balance it out, if a 5/10 film is sitting at 8/10 I feel like I have to say in my review it's true rating but then actually rate it a 1/10 to counter act the manipulation.

This was my state when I saw this film. It left me bewildered as to what films can achieve. This experience enhanced my perspective.   

It’s a story told by a standpoint of young girl, Linda Manz. A plan that was supposed to work didn’t work. It’s a simple story of error of judgment and perhaps avarice. The story itself may not be very unique or something that stays with you for a long time, but the realism of characters would. The story is sad and it seen when even in the happiest moments of the characters, every character seems out of place, out of order, as if they are not fulfilled. A film this short, usually don’t have a lot of character development and I can comfortably say that it’s indeed lacking. At the times where you ought to connect with the characters on a deeper level, there’s a reminder that you don’t know enough about the character and that’s a shortcoming of this film.    

The word that I would pick to describe this film is “ beautiful”. Painterly images, the limitless prairies of Texas, sky, snow, rivers and horses can all be seen throughout the film. The credit for cinematography goes to the Cuban Nestor Almendros, who won an Oscar for the film; ""Days of Heaven'' established him in America, where he went on to great success.  

It’s a movie that is worth watching and worth dwelling into. There’s also excellent writing such as this “  The sun looks ghostly when there's a mist on a river and everything's quiet. I never knowed it before. And you could see people on the shore, but they was far off and you couldn't see what they were doing. They were probably... calling for help or something, or they were trying to bury somebody or something.”

From there, we gained a Line Producer, a casting director, a post-production company, a VFX company, two major producers, a sales rep, a management company, and a director.

But, if I pay for a complete line budget, you better believe that this is the script.

It was okay. Solid 7/10 - a fun matinee movie.

Not bad, but some of the humour falls flat, especially some of the one liners between AM and Mera. 

Tonally, it is much, much lighter than previous DC movies. 

Soundtrack is barely noticeable except for some cool Blade Runneresque stuff in Atlantis. 

Some of the cast seem really out of place...like as in not a good fit for the movie (Dolph Lundgren and Patrick Wilson specifically). 

It is post Justice League, and Steppenwolf is mentioned by name. There are no other DC Universe name drops, but Aquaman is known to the public now and the public is slowly becoming aware of Atlantis. 

There's a joke in ""Andy Richter Controls the Universe"" about him blowing up a city of Mer-People when he makes a mistake in a submarine schematic that I could not get out of my head while watching the movie. 

Black Manta was cool.

There is a cool riff on Aquaman's ""classic"" look, which I liked. 

There is a mid credits scene, but I don't know about post credits, because I had to pee and I left. 

There's some cool visual designs for Atlantis and I like how they took Aquaman's power of talking to fish, which has been the butt of jokes probably since Superfriends in the 70s, and turned it into something useful and practical for the movie.

The problem is that it just doesn't do anything to stand out. It doesn't really give a unique spin to the super hero genre.

I almost wish it had taken a more environmental tack, which is touched upon but only briefly as that would have given it a different flavour.

I  really love Jason Statham. He's the best part of every bad action movie  I've seen him in. He's the embodiment of pure masculine energy and a  reminder of the 80's and 90's action movies of yesterday.

That  being said, I had never seen what was arguably his most defining film  series of the 2000's: The Transporter trilogy. I went into it with high  expectations.  
If you want to watch my video for my full thoughts on the movies [you can do so here.](https://youtu.be/bTwWuqVaPsI) If not, here's the cliff-notes of what I thought:

The  Transporter: disappointingly boring. Statham wasn't very Statham-y yet.  I guess he was still getting used to being an action hero. It wasn't as  crazy or over-the-top as I wished it was, but it was ok. A standard  action movie.

Transporter 2: I LOVE THIS  MOVIE! It's exactly what I want in a Statham movie. Statham gets to kick  ass and do crazy stunts, there is plenty of action with an over-the-top  vibe, and, bonus, a hot blonde runs around in her underwear shooting  people the entire movie! This is one of my favorite Statham movies now.

Transporter  3: Directed by the asshat who made Taken 2 and 3, so obviously, it's  really bad. You can't see most of the fight choreography because of the  atrocious editing. Worst of all, the female love interest forces Statham  to strip for her and have sex despite his clear disinterest. This movie  sucks ass. It was wasted potential.

Glad  I finally got to watch these because I felt like I was missing out.  Statham is in a lot of movies, so I've got plenty more to watch.  Any  recommendations for good Statham movies? Or thoughts on Statham and the  Transporter in general?",False,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

_____
**What's it about?**

*From IMDb:* 

* A disillusioned Confederate army deserter (Newton Knight = McConaughey) returns to Mississippi and leads a militia of fellow deserters and women (and slaves) in an uprising against the corrupt local Confederate government.

*Additional info (without spoilers)*

* It's based on true events (or rather two books about those) and as I understand it, in generally sticks to the truth. If wiki is right, there's not many contemporary sources

* It's set in Jones County, Mississippi; the story begins in 1862 and goes on for a short while after the end of the war  

* Slavery and racism are central to the story and become more important as the film progresses

*Tiny bit spoiler-y*

* It's not a feel-good story. Good and bad things happen and the film never shows either in an over the top manner. Overall it stays pretty grounded, which fits the film and the topic. One example for this is (very mild spoiler, it's info you get within the first 10 minutes): Newton doesn't desert because he this noble guy who wants to free the slaves. He has more selfish, but perfectly understandable reasons, and even though he doesn't support slavery, I didn't get the impression he was willing to die just for this cause. 

* The North wins (what a surprise!), but the films shows this didn't eradicate racism. That the movie includes this is very valuable I think 
 
____



**Director, cast and stats**

*Director and cast*

* Gary Ross as director and writer (Ocean's 8, Hunger Games, Seabiscuit, Pleasantville, Dave, Big) 

* Matthew McConaughey  

* Gugu Mbatha-Raw (Belle, Beyond the Lights; Black Mirror Episode 'San Junipero')

* Mahershala Ali (Moonlight and a bunch of other stuff)

* Keri Russell (The Americans) 

*Stats*

* Runtime: 140 minutes

* Budget: $50m

* Box office: $25m 

____
**My opinion aka my ramblings**

* It's an unusual film. It doesn't feel epic in scale like many period pieces. Some reviews, which I read afterwards, said it felt like a made-for-TV movie. I might agree with that because when I think about the film there are a bunch of scenes that I think in a typical Hollywood movie would look more polished or elaborate. This doesn't mean this inherently bad, it fits the tone imo. The first battle scene is grisly and the aftermath is grisly, after that it becomes more about Newton and his relationships to others and ofc his fight vs the Confederates. 

* Newton Knight is the hero and I don't think the film ever portrays him in a bad light. Idk what kind of guy he was in real life, but you probably could've been more nuanced here. Some reviews criticized the film for being all about the 'white savior'. I can't agree with this. Yes, he's the hero. And some of the black characters could've or maybe should've been more fleshed out (for example you could've gone more in depth about their experiences as slaves or their opinion on white people and what they are all doing) but the same is true about any other character. The film and the people in it revolve around Newton Knight, for better or worse. And many people needed help, the slaves the same as the poor farmers who had to give up nearly everything as part of their tax to support the war.

* I already mentioned this above, but it's a point worth reiterating: It's good that the story doesn't end with the North winning. The third act is different compared to the first two, it's slower and shows that even though the slaves were freed, they didn't live in a world that was easy or fair to them, far from it. 


* Weird pacing: It's long at over 2h10m (excl. credits). IIRC there are a couple of time when the time skips forward in order to pick up the story again at a more interesting point in time. Every once in a while there are 'footnotes' (text in one corner of the screen) telling you some historical detail or context. Multiple times the film flashes forward about 80 years to tell you something about Newton's great-grandson - the first time this happens my reaction was essentially ""wtf is this?!"", but in the end I think it works because it drives home the or one of the messages of the third act. It's still odd, though. 

* Performances were good; there's no standout performance and I don't think the film was made with the goal of having one actor (like McConaughey) steal the show, even though he is the clear protagonist and hero of the story. 


* All in all, it felt a bit like you asked someone knowledgeable about the topic about Newton Knight and the Free State of Jones and that person then tells you what they know. It's a bit of a scattershot of Newton and the events that unfolded because of him. This also means the storytelling with its pacing peculiarities I mentioned above isn't tight and focused. Some would say it's inconsistent, but to me it was slow and somewhat unusual. 

____
I think this movie will bore (or has bored) its fair share viewers to sleep, but there should also be plenty of people who enjoy this type of film and imo they should give it a try.

Shutter Island...clarification of ending??,movies,3,a3lgh0,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/a3lgh0/shutter_islandclarification_of_ending/,7,2018-12-06 01:40:05,"So I've watched Shutter Island twice now and it's quickly become one of my favorite movies. A masterpiece, and a truly stunning and mind-warping experience.

I pretty much understand everything now. But one thing that's still a little strange to me is the ending. I've read in articles and stuff that the movie shows that the entire role-play treatment worked on Andrew. Worked as in, it did drive him to the end of realizing and fully admitting that his fantasies are all made up and to accept the truth that he killed his wife because she killed their kids...more so, he failed because he knew she was mentally troubled for a long time but didn't do anything about it.

He can't live with that guilt...it's too unbearable, so that final scene...he pretends to regress back into the ""Teddy"" character who pretends he's still a marshal, etc. Now, everything points to him pretending to regress so that he is lobotomized...he WANTS to be lobotomized so he doesn't have to feel the pain of his guilt anymore. But his doctor, sitting on the steps with him, hears him ""regress"" back into Teddy, and shakes his head at Dr. Cawley and the others, indicating that he's regressed again and will have be lobotomized.

So sure, the entire role-play treatment did work, but the way the movie ends, it would seem to suggest that the doctors and warden believe that since he has regressed again (or so they think), they think their entire treatment did NOT work. The only thing that undermines this is how Andrew gets up and walks calmly ahead, ready to be lobotomized, and the guards and doctors follow. What are they thinking in this moment? Aren't they wondering why Andrew WANTS to be lobotomized? And I find it hard to believe they would go ahead with the surgery if Andrew was practically asking for it...it would no longer be necessary if he wasn't violent.",False,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0

More often than not, it's either the happy ending where the protagonist wins and everything is peachy after that or the bittersweet ending where the protagonist wins, but not without having lost something or someone they care about. But, to my knowledge, I haven't really seen a horror movie with a true pyrrhic victory where the protagonist may as well have lost because they've lost so much in their trek to victory.

What are some examples of movies where you're surprised to see characters making realistic decisions and suffering realistic consequences?,movies,8,a3ek9j,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/a3ek9j/what_are_some_examples_of_movies_where_youre/,26,2018-12-05 12:40:03,"I just finished watching Eighth Grade and I was absolutely blown away by the levels of realism this movie uses.

Eighth Grade is a movie about a shy teenage girl trying to gain confidence. In a typical movie, this girl would win over the dream guy, become cooler than the mean popular kids, and enter high school as a confident badass. Won't get into specifics, but I was so amazed to see Eighth Grade do not just a different take on that story, but instead they did it in an incredibly down to earth, ""holy shit that happened to me"" kind of way. 

 I appreciate it when a movie uses realism, because it's almost like a little twist. You expect the character to do the ""movie plotline"" choice, but when they act like a *real person*, or suffer consequences that *real people* experience in that situation, you're taken aback because movies **never** do this. 

I can't help but think of [this scene](https://youtu.be/zRClOJWK9zg) from the Nice Guys when thinking of other examples. You expect this scene to go to the formula: he breaks the glass, unlocks the door, and searches the empty building for clues.  When this didn't happen, I knew I was about to experience something unique.

So I'm trying to find other movies that surprise you in this fashion. As I said, Nice Guys is like this, obviously Eighth Grade is too. Searching is another one that's fairly similar.

 Any other recommendations? I'd also be glad to hear your thoughts on these sort of movies. Am I wrong in my thinking?

I was watching Terminator Salvation again this evening and several times I felt like the dialogue was poor. The particular worst instances were 

1. When John Connor says, “I’ll be back.” I don’t need to explain why I feel that was poor writing. I get it, it’s just a little homage to the original lines from original Terminator, but still. It’s like when C3P0 falls down and says, “ I’ve fallen and I can’t get up!” As a viewer I kinda feel like it’s schlocky. 

2. When Barnes and Connor are testing the short wave radio scrambler on the hunter killer. The scene opens with Barnes saying something like,”We’re in Skynet’s valley of death. We’ve never been this deep before.” I immediately thought, why would he say that to John Connor, he would certainly know how deep the resistance has been? 

So, obviously the writers felt the need to add those lines in so the audience would be able to know what / where the scene was taking place. I can accept the reason, but still feel the dialogue is kinda weird. 

So, my questions are, is this type of dialogue necessary? 
Is this type of dialogue what people complain about when they criticize shitty writing? 
What are you guys’ thoughts on dialogue as a tool? 
And finally, can you give me examples of what you think some poor dialogue is in any particular movie? 

Ultimately, I am the easiest non critical movie fan, so It takes a lot for me to notice something like poor writing. So, I’d like to get a broader feel. 

It doesn’t have to be Terminator Salvation. For the record I enjoyed the movie, just at certain parts I considered the dialogue question.

Movie detail: There was a part where the Mom gives a complement and says 'wow self-made woman, your Mom must be very proud'.

The possible twist to the upcoming Glass film.,movies,0,a3l91c,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/a3l91c/the_possible_twist_to_the_upcoming_glass_film/,5,2018-12-06 01:08:54,"Without making you read a bunch, cuz this theory is lonnnng winded.. and also has an extra meta higher dimensional theory on top of it afterwards.... My theory is that all the super characters as well as others are delusions inside the girls head. The girl from Split, that is. I forget her name.

Now my reasoning. I remember contemplating what the twist could be and this idea occurred to me. I figured it must be the girl who acts as the stage. So I watched the movie a second time looking for possible clues. I got the impression big time for some reason that I was right. I could smell it, but that doesn't really count as evidence.

But then... Evidence happened. The scene where the old lady psychologist visits Mr. Split. She sneaks away to open the door to find one of the teenage hostages... Do you remember? Did you notice it too?

The old lady is standing there clear as day in the open door yet the teenager calls out, hello? Is anyone there? Heellllp! Or something like that.

Huh? Is she blind? Was the writing bad? Why would she ask if anyone is there when the old lady is standing right there in plain view?

I think it means my theory could be correct. Somehow. I believe this was an intentional clue to show us that the old lady wasn't really there in some capacity. And since we are dealing with crazies I figure it means she is also another imagined character. But in whose head?

James Macavoy's head? What would be the point in that? Surprise! It turns out he imagined the therapist! *Gasp* A schizo having an imaginary shrink. I don't think so. 

Could all of this be taking place in Mr. Glass' head? It's possible, I suppose. But to me, that seems too obvious and kinda anti-climactic. Lazy even.

To me.. it's gotta be the girl. Right? Think about it for a sec. It seems like each super character could represent a different type of coping mechanism of having a big, fat, hairy uncle molest you.

Let's start with Unbreakable himself and also his son. The girl lost her dad who she clearly looked up to. The one who could've protected her, but didn't and unknowingly allowed her to be molested cuz she didn't speak up. And then of course died. SO she imagines a version where her dad can't die and she's his little sidekick who helps him discover his powers. Perhaps as she should've done by telling him she was being raped. And not only that, he's a fucking badass hero that could easily choke out a big dude. Kinda like the uncle. 

It just occurred to me that it's interesting that Unbreakable choked out the orange man. Wasn't the uncle wearing orange hunting colors? I can't remember. I don't exactly wanna go Google CHILD MOLESTATION SCENE. So forgive me.

Okay so now we have Mr Glass. That could easily represent the broken feeling of being raped by a big fat hairy uncle,right? He's broken yet he's highly intelligent. Much like she is. Mainly due to the fact that she has been put through adversity like Mr. Glass.

It's like Unbreakable and Mr. Glass represent a kind of duality for her character. On one hand she needs to be strong to face life having to be raped by a fat uncle, as she clearly is... yet at the same time she is broken by it.

Then we have Split. This one is multi-faceted. To me.. he seems like some kinda agent of agency. If that makes sense. Let me back up a sec though. If she is in fact crazy now, she might have some vague understanding of that fact. If she's in the system or seeing a shrink, she is no doubt surrounded by folks telling her she is crazy and trying to treat her for it, et cetera. So he could represent a a version where she realizes in some sense she is delusional. 

He (and the movie's plot) would also represent a scary situation that she herself survives, ya know? She didn't have to create a hero or powers to survive him. She doesnt have to be a villain and forward her hurt on others like Mr. glass. 

Instead of being a victim, she used her real life ingenuity and agency to survive him and in the end this part of her psyche acknowledged her for it. It howls as it realizes she is strong and beautiful for having survived some shit in life. Ya know? And she just so happens to immediately take agency against her uncle in the end of the movie. Hmmm.

She could pretend it's not happening and let it continue by numbing herself to it: Unbreakable.

She could let it break her and in turn let it turn her into a villain to society, cutting herself, being miserable and distant to other girls etc: Mr. Glass

Or she could take a giant step back and literally GET some agency in life and do something about it: Split.

But also..I believe Split represents a sort of balance between the two extremes, or a catalyst to it. And the coming film, Glass is the result of her waking up to this and taking agency. But it's not so simple and there will be a battle in her psyche between them all. 

The three form like a triangle with Split being at the top point.. and her character is a spot above the triangle if that makes sense. I believe the next movie will really establish this as this most recent one had to kind of set it up.

If you think this isn't possible cuz of her age I would posit that each delusion comes with a fully fleshed out back story, just like Split does, and she wouldn't exactly need to fit a tight timeline. She is 3 or 4 and starts imagining a hero figure. Then she imagines the movie Unbreakable over time etc.



Anyway so all that aside. I also noticed the movie is like a meta story about Shyamalan himself. This is what ultimately led to my whole theory in the first place. 

Basically M Night retconned his own tumultuous relationship with Hollywood and success into the Unbreakable universe.

He was this new badass writer AND director. He was celebrated as the best shit since sliced bread. Sixth Sense. 

He makes Unbreakable, his masterpiece, the best hero film ever made. Nobody really goes to see it. He knows it's the shit, but money talks. Doubt creeps in. He better go with the plot twist hard next time.

He makes Signs. It's a success. Phew. But did people like, get it? Or did they just like aliens and Mel Gibson? Oh well, his real fans got it. Fuck the plebs. He's the shit.

He makes The Village, a beautiful love story disguised as a horror story. Nobody got this one. They shit all over it. Cuz they're dumb. He is the shit. Fuck em.

He makes Lady In The Water and shits back at the plebs writing himself in as a world changing brilliant writer and also writes in plebs to be  eaten by monster. Well, the plebs shit back harder, big time.

Everyone turns on him and he makes dud after dud after dud for years. Fuck. Was everyone right? Is he NOT the shit?

So then he starts writing Split. I believe he represents the girl in the story for sure as well as Macavoy's character. 

Basically, M. Night sees himself as both a good and bad director. He wants to believes he's a good director. Unbreakable. He doubts himself. Mr. Glass. And the movie Split is his battle between the two ways he sees himself. As he is writing, he realizes he's got a hit on his hands. He has hope again! Just like the girl does by the end of the film. He sees his failures as learning experiences etc.

/r/Letterboxd was basically completely abandoned by its sole creator/moderator, and the sub pretty much turned into a profile spam-fest, so I created /r/LetterboxdOfficial.

I've not watched the film a lot since my teen years. To an extent the film is far to familiar for me, but having watched it recently older I've found it to be quite the film.

Ice Cube and Lawrence Fishburne are the two highlights in terms of performance in my opinion. If you really want a compass that represents the positive and the negative, their two characters are it.

The film is also very unforgiving to its characters and doesn't pull any punches in its tone, all the while staying true to a narrative. A lot of films in this genre seem to rely on very simplistic themes that showcase the ''Ghetto''. This films does that but tries to get its message across in a very subtle way.

My main reason for this is that Toy Story 3 was such a great ending that to continue the story after that would feel strange. However, Toy Story 4 could be a prequel that follows Andy's Dad and how he came across Woody. Toy Story 4 was quoted to be a very emotional film and Tom Hanks teared up recording the lines. So I don't want to entirely recap the story described in this video so I really recommend watching it but Andy's Dad supposedly died right before Toy Story 1(Andy has a sister who is an infant so it can't be more than 2 years since he died). Andy's dad was also named Andy and he was born in the 1950s and cursed with the horrible disease of polio. He was poor and could not afford many toys but his favorite show(Sheriff Woody) was holding a contest to win a Woody doll. However, he could not collect the required amount of boxtops to win the doll but he sent in a sweet letter asking for the doll with pictures drawn over it. The same year, 1957, Sputnik was launched and toy companies figured that kids were tired of cowboys and would only want spacemen toys. There was only one prototype so they decided to send it to Andy Sr. Fast forward to right before Toy Story 1, Andy's dad dies of Post-Polio syndrome but right before he gives Andy a key to a chest with all his toys. They have been in hibernation and since Andy Jr looking strikingly like his dad and has the same name, they think it is the same Andy. In the teaser, you see a homemade toy, which I think could be a toy Andy Sr. makes due to the lack of money to buy his own toys. The only piece of evidence that disputes this theory are the toys that were not at the beginning of Toy Story 1 are in the teaser.

One of these shorts, ""Meal Ticket,"" is the story of >!an impresario and a limbless orator who travel the West offering recitals of sonnets, biblical passages, Shakespeare, and Lincoln speeches. Eventually the demand for this show falls off and the impresario decides to go with a mathematician chicken instead of the limbless orator and throws the limbless orator off a bridge into a river and kills him.!< It's a bleak, bleak story. 

I have this theory about it that makes it even bleaker. I'll start by saying I'm probably wrong but as I watched the film I couldn't shake the following idea. During the course of the story >!the impresario goes to a brothel. He keeps the limbless orator in the room with him as he and the prostitute have sex. After their session the prostitute asks if the limbless orator wants any loving too? ""No,"" the impresario replies. ""Has he ever had any?"" she asks. ""Once,"" the impresario says. !<

Many people online are asking what the impresario meant with his answer. **Here is what I kept thinking: the limbless orator was once caught having sex with the impresario's wife and as punishment the impresario cut off his limbs and forced him to work for him.** 

There are a few things that support this theory: First, the impresario >!looks quite gleeful when he murders the limbless man!<. Second, the material limbless man recites are often concerned with things being severed (Ozymandias poem has a trunkless body, Lincoln's Gettysburg Address is about the US Civil War where the southern states cut themselves off from the Union, *The Merchant Of Venice* is famous for Shylock demanding his pound of flesh). Finally, the limbless narrator quotes the book of Genesis where Cain complains that his ""punishment is too much to bear.""

Again, I realize this is crazy and probably not right but I just couldn't stop thinking about it during my initial watch and then my re-watch of the film.

Why are you expecting more from it?"" I always hated this response because there *are* dumb characters/movies that I actually like. I have been really thinking about explicitly why I hate the two main characters in this movie so much and not other ""dumb characters."" I wanted to find something objective and not just ""bad writing"" because that's so vague and rather subjective. I think I've figured it out.

&#x200B;

Let me compare two dumb characters: Jim Carrey in D&D and oh say Sid from ice Age. They're both dumb, overconfident idiots who screw things up and are played for laughs. I ***hate*** Jim Carrey but don't mind Sid. What's the difference? When Sid does something stupid, it comes back to bite him. Either it directly hurts him, or other characters do something. Meanwhile with Jim Carrey, he NEVER faces any consequences for his stupidity. His stupid antics cause other people grief instead.

&#x200B;

In short, when Sid is stupid, he gets smacked. When Jim Carrey is stupid, he smacks everyone else.

&#x200B;

To me this completely breaks the movie. Ultimately, D&D portrays the two mains as stupid but it's trying to still say ""hey they're good people inside and you want them to succeed don't you?"" which makes me want to scream because I find they have given me literally zero reason to root for them. They've ruined several innocent people and faced absolutely zero repercussions. 

&#x200B;

When I realized this, my main reaction was ""why does this not seem to bother most other people?"" D&D is liked by a huge amount of people and I'm clearly in the minority. But....why? Isn't connecting with characters supposed to be, like, the whole point? This extends to other characters I feel are presented as ""feel bad for them"" when they are just irredeemable jackasses (Julia Roberts in My Best Friend's Wedding and Lestat in Interview with a Vampire are the other main ones that come to mind for me).

Pretty much every thing I want in a thriller.

Anyway, I didn't see any Internet post focusing primarily on these two characters despite their plight being way worse than what the protagonists of the movie encountered:

1. Both get kidnapped as kids. Alex Jones is released in his late teens or young adulthood; either way, considering he must be 16+ (due to valid license), he was kidnapped for at least a DECADE. That's a decade's worth of drugging and brainwashing and possibly even physical and sexual abuse - this massively dwarfs what the protagonists' (the Dovers and Birches) children faced.

2. Severely depleted mental and social development. The long-term drugging and brainwashing would very likely have contributed to the mental retardation (he was said to have the IQ of a 10yo) attributed at least to Alex Jones. Both Bob and Alex were unable to interact normally with people or speak ill of their captors. A decade+-long kidnapping would also mean no school and hence inability to develop the basic academic and intellectual skills. The kidnapping involved having the kids finish puzzles in a book, except the last puzzle was unsolvable. For Bob, desperate to get out, this would've meant obsessing over that last puzzle for months, if not years. Eventually, with no other stimulation, as an adult he develops an unnatural obsession for that one last puzzle in addition to snakes and children's clothes, the only other things abundant in his environment. The kidnapping truly screwed their entire lives up in just about every way.

3. Last but certainly not the least, on top of all this, now after they've already suffered through so much they are treated extremely poorly by the outside world. Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman's character) himself kidnaps Alex and tortures him mercilessly, smashing up his face and then showering him with extreme hot and cold water while being imprisoned in a dark room. Now it may be argued Alex could've given up the children's whereabouts right away, but I'm sure the decade-long brainwashing of not speaking against his captors would've surely played a role. In hindsight, we could see Alex had clearly not harmed the children in any way. Similarly, Bob, with all that psychological trauma capped with Detective Loki's attack on him, desperately commits suicide.",False,0.6003,0.066,0.706,0.228

Perhaps I'm reading too much into it; maybe the film is just a story about two charming psychopaths who found each other.  But PTA movies usually have some deeper commentary to them.  Is the broader thematic idea of Phantom Thread that women, as romantic interests, can only impede great men?  It's only after the introduction of the love interest that the leading man's confidence wavers and his mental state deteriorates.

Alma's individuality is an inconvenience to Reynolds for much of the film.  Her adoration is worthless to Reynolds, her needs immaterial.  She only ever captures his imagination by becoming an agent of his destruction.  What are we supposed to take away from that?  That being in a functioning relationship with an ingenious man who's hyper-devoted to his craft necessarily requires a cycle of abuse?  I couldn't help but think that PTA, the hyper-devoted genius, was mirroring his own love life in some way, but as far as I know he's been happily married for more than a decade.

**Notable Box Office Stories**

* **Ralph Breaks the Internet -** In more of a win by default, Ralph Breaks the Internet took #1 this weekend with a solid $25.7M[.](https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/ralph-breaks-the-internet.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1) That's not an amazing hold but for opening over $80M during the Thanksgiving break it's not too bad, most notably putting it on track with Moana which many felt opened somewhat low in the same spot but ended up pulling out an almost $250M domestic run. Ralph's drop though is a bit worrisome when you compare it to the first film which is the rare Disney Animation Studios film to not crack $200M domestic and $500M worldwide. With a stronger start it's possible that RBTI will manage to pass those milestones but just barely. Disney Animation rarely makes sequels but in the pipeline already is Frozen 2 and Zootopia 2 so RBTI is one of the first of this new generation of sequels to make it to market, but I don't think it's really comparable to this film which already is as close to a niche property as modern Disney gets. It's unclear where Disney goes from here. For one it's possible RBTI is a favor to director Rich Moore who apparently helped saved Zootopia and turn it into the massive hit it was. And it could be Ralph is just profitable enough to justify itself and garner some interesting film twitter conversations along the way. But I wouldn't be shocked if this is the final full adventure for Ralph. I can see Disney transitioning him into more of a Mickey Mouse role, an interesting figure who more exists as brand identity than a fully fleshed out character. 
* **Possession of Hannah Grace -** I had a whole bitter write-up about this film but it got deleted and I realized who cares. The studio didn't, why else release a horror film with no pre-screenings for critics in one of the historically worst weekends of the year. Are you shocked it only made $6.5M at #7? Is it really that crazy it got a 13% on RT and a C score on Cinemascore. This is a classic cynical dumping grounds movie and it's not really even worth my time to get that upset about it.
* **Bohemian Rhapsody -** The surprising hit film about unknown indie rock band Queen has hit some major milestones this week. First off, it became the highest grossing music biopic domestically after passing the lifetime gross of Straight Outta Compton ($161.1M). Secondly, it has now become the first film in history that stars an openly queer protagonist to pass $500M worldwide. This is a huge step in queer representation on screen for one key reason, films need to appeal globally these days and globally the world ain't as woke about queer people as they are in the US. [Just take a look at this map](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/World_laws_pertaining_to_homosexual_relationships_and_expression.svg) and note that all the beige countries have laws restricting freedom of queer expression and the yellow, orange, red, and maroon countries are places where it is illegal to have romantic/sexual same-sex relations (the maroons are the death penalty for such relations btw). When you get a bigger view of just how far the fight for queer civil rights is from being over it becomes more clear why Hollywood is so reticent to send out queer characters in major blockbuster films. That's the weird thing about Hollywood, for how liberal so many of the filmmakers are their exports are becoming more conservative as they appeal to a more global market. Just look at the insane backlash when Hollywood patted itself on the back for praising itself having queer characters in films like Beauty and the Beast '17 and Power Rangers '17. And despite the queer representation being as mild as possible those films still had notable calls for being banned in repressive countries. While Bohemian Rhapsody has had some blowback from the queer community for its depiction of Freddie Mercury's bisexuality, it is a film that openly acknowledges Mercury having male and female partners with romantic scenes with both. Now I do understand it isn't the ultimate end all be all of queer representation stepping forward. This is still a film that could be viewed by homophobic people as ""look at the gay getting his just desserts by dying of AIDS"". It's also historical fact that Mercury was bi so it's not quite the same as say making a Wonder Woman movie where her new love interest is a woman. And it's quite possible the film is heavily edited in more homophobic countries. But still seeing the film making almost $15M in a very repressive against gays country like Russia is pretty interesting and hopefully a step forward in more queer representation in the future. 
* **Oscar Movie Round-Up -** Even the Oscar expansion race didn't have much to speak of with only **The Favourite** getting a few more screens. The film jumped to 34 theaters but made over $1M in just that small release, a per theater average of $32,500. The film is looking more and more like it has some surprising box office potential, perhaps lead by the wonderful dark trailer or the just general interest and fascinating with British monarchy kicked off recently by Netflix's The Crown. Whatever the reason it will be interesting to follow as the film very slowly creeps towards a wide release throughout December.

A Review of Bob Lazar: Area 51 and Flying Saucers - the new UFO film by Jeremy Corbell,movies,1,a367s8,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/a367s8/a_review_of_bob_lazar_area_51_and_flying_saucers/,4,2018-12-04 18:25:02,"I went to the LA premiere of Corbells' new film - Bob Lazar: Area 51 and Flying Saucers. These are my opinions of the film.

I won't spoil any new subject matter or footage featured in the film out of respect for Corbell as an independent filmmaker.

Unfortunately... the film was a dud. Corbell missed a big opportunity here. It comes across as a love letter to Lazar and his story, packaged for the masses, but has little in the way of actual substance. It does not go in-depth at all - in fact there are YouTube docs that are way more in-depth than this - and for a subject that is treated so seriously, it is watered down by massive amounts of filler. There is so much amazing footage that is not shown or featured that you can find on the internet that could have been utilized; it really is a shame.

In all fairness - there IS some new information and never-seen-before footage. There are also some extended looks at old interviews that are mildly interesting. The issue is, the amount of ""new"" material is vastly overshadowed by bells and whistles. The film tells the BASIC story and provides a few minor revelations, but that is about it.

Half of the run time of the film is sucked up by pretentious soliloquy segments (pieces of which make up most of the trailer) narrated by Mickey Rourke, who must have showed up drunk. No one around me, including myself, could understand a word he was slurring. I call this the ""Bane effect"", as this is an audio mixing (and casting) problem that marred The Dark Knight Rises.

Furthermore, technically, the film is a mess. The audio levels are all over the place (going from muffled to peaking in seconds). Often, Corbell interviews his subjects in echo-y locations (George Knapp is interviewed in a pool area and the reverb is obnoxious, Lazar gets similar treatment as well). Do you have a lav Jeremy? You gotta invest in a lav and stop relying on the Zoom recorder. Also, the structure of the film is all over the place, and copious amounts of the run-time is afforded to things that don't pay off, giving new meaning to ""style over substance"".

Corbell seems like a nice dude, seems like he has the best intentions... but for a film about Bob Lazar, Corbell is ALL OVER the thing. If you ever wanted to see Jeremy Corbell barefoot, in his kitchen, talking on the phone - this is the film for you. If you want to see Corbell in a pink-lit bathroom, being sad in slow motion - this is the film for you. I fear that he is going the way of Steven Greer - starting with good intentions, getting good footage and access to interesting subjects, and eventually falling prey to hubris and looking like a complete fraud in the end. It's a slippery slope Corbell, watch out buddy.

Don't listen to me though, if you wanna see it, check it out. Gotta give Corbell props for trying. He's amassed quite a following, but it's all about how you use it.

*Oh yeah, funny easter egg: Jeremy's middle name ""Lockyer"" was spelled wrong in one of the title cards of the credits. Whoopz.

  A live action Black cauldron would be absolutely *insane* to see in today’s age. It’s familiar yet unique enough to be interesting, and since the original film was dark already, it would be intriguing to see how that translates into the world of 2019+.

  But it doesn’t have to stop there! Disney could also make treasure planet and Atlantis live action films as well- these are the movies with unique plots that went under appreciated when they were released, and I think that with the dearth of original ideas now- these pioneering adventures would do very well rebranded into the age of contemporary (post 2010) cinema.
